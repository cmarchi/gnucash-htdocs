2011-10-08

<h2>Gnucash MacOS X Packages Updated for Lion Compatibility</h2>

<p>New downloadable disk images (DMGs) are available for Mac users of Gnucash; follow the link at the top of the page or the <a href="http://www.gnucash.org/download.phtml">Downloads page</a> to get them.</p>

<p>No changes to Gnucash itself are in the new images; rather, a new build of Gtk+ provides compatibility with OS X Versions 10.5 (Leopard), 10.6 (Snow Leopard), and 10.7 (Lion), as well as several bugfixes and stability improvements. We recommend this update for all OS X users, not just those using Lion.</p>
