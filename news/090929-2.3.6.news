<b>Announcement:</b> GnuCash 2.3.6 Release
2009-09-29

<h2>GnuCash 2.3.9 released</h2>

<p>The GnuCash development team proudly announces GnuCash 2.3.6, the seventh of several unstable 2.3.x releases of the GnuCash Free Accounting Software which will eventually lead to the stable version 2.4.0. With this new release series, GnuCash can use an SQL database using SQLite3, MySQL or PostgreSQL. It runs on GNU/Linux, *BSD, Solaris, Microsoft Windows and Mac OSX. This release is intended for developers and testers who want to help tracking down all those bugs that are still in there.</p>
<p> WARNING WARNING WARNING - Make sure you make backups of any files used in testing versions of GnuCash in the 2.3.x series. Although the developers go to great lengths to ensure that no data will be lost we cannot guarantee that your data will not be affected if for some reason GnuCash crashes in testing these releases.</p>
<p>PLEASE TEST TEST AND TEST SOME MORE any and all features important to you.
Then post any bugs you find to bugzilla</p>
<p>Major changes in the 2.3.x release include;
<ul>
<li>In addition to the XML backend, Gnucash can now use a SQLite3, MySQL or PostgreSQL database to store the data. This is a new implementation using libdbi. It supports all features including the business features.  In order to build with this, add --enable-dbi to the configure command.  In addition to the libdbi-dev package for your distribution, you will also need the appropriate DBD (libdbi driver) package for sqlite3, mysql or postgresql.</li>
<li>In addition to the current GtkHTML HTML engine used to display reports and graphs, Gnucash can use WebKit. WebKit is the engine used by Google Chrome on Windows and Safari on Apple.  In order to build with this, add --enable-webkit to the configure command.  You will need an appropriate webkit-dev package.  On win32, you will need to download the webkit-1.1.5-win32.zip file from the source repository and put it into the downloads directory of your gnucash build area.</li>
<li>Updated to AqBanking 3 on Win32.</li>
</ul>

<li>Fix some memory leaks</li>
<li>Add some dbi backend tests to test db save/load. In order to test the mysql backend, the --with-test-mysql-url=URL option must be supplied to configure where URL is the full url (mysql://host[:port]:db:user:password) to access a mysql db. The same is true for postgres, with the --with-test-pgsql-url=URL option.</li>
<li>Python bindings patches by Mark Jenkins. python_GetNthChild_remove.patch remove the redundant GetNthChild code, gnc_account_nth_child supported python_more_GUID.patch Improve support for GUID python_better_commodity.patch * Removed custom __init__ from GncCommodity, not only is it wrong but the one from GnuCashCoreClass is just fine. * Supported the get_table method For Book * Removed support for direct instantiation of GncCommodityTable. (via gnc_commodity_table_new() ). Only methods and not the constructor function are added to the class now. Python binding users can access a GncCommodityTable instance via Book.get_table() and have no need to use gnc_commodity_table_new(), which the apis advise is for internal use only. python_GncLot.patch * included gnc-lot.h in gnucash_core.i again * Made GncLot class use superclass __init__, it doesn't need its own.  python_more_documentation.patch Documentation strings for many classes, which can be viewed in source and with python's help() mechanism. python_business_module_load.patch load the business module, not the business module specific backend python_example_scripts.py example scripts improved, new one added. This new script originally came from this post: http://lists.gnucash.org/pipermail/gnucash-devel/2008-July/023618.html python_authors_update.patch added Legal Aid Manitoba to credit line for Mark Jenkins</li>
<li>Use "float8" instead of "real" for double field in slots table so that we get an 8 byte float rather than only 4 byte.</li>
<li>Doubles weren't being loaded properly from sqlite3. Fix that problem by examine more closely the type information returned by libdbi.</li>
<li>Fix bug where NULL dates on sqlite cause sigsegv</li>
<li>Updated Slovak translation, copied from the Translation Project.</li>
<li>Updated Danish translation by Joe Hansen, copied from the Translation Project.</li>

<p><b>Caveats for Testers</b></p>
<p>Any 2.3.x version might crash unexpectedly at any point during runtime. If you test some serious work in a 2.3.x release and are using the XML file backend for data storage, make sure you hit "Save" after every non-trivial workstep.  If you are using the SQL backend, this is not required as every change is saved immediately to the database.<p>
<p>The documentation has had screenshots updated, however, many help texts usually only refers to the 1.8.x series. Everyone is invited to help improve the documentation; see http://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/Development on how to get involved.</p>

<p><b>How can you help?</b></p>
<p>Testing: Test it and help us discover all bugs that might show up in there.  Please enter each and every bug into bugzilla.</p>
<p>Translating: The new release comes with some new translation strings. If you consider contributing a translation, we invite you to test this release already. A string freeze will be announced in one of the later 2.3.x releases.  Please check http://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/Translation_Status for updates on this.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We would like to encourage people to test this and any further releases as much as possible and submit bug reports in order that we can polish GnuCash to be as stable as possible for the 2.4.0 release in a few weeks. Then post any bugs you find to <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=GnuCash">bugzilla</a></p>
