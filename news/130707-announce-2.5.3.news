<h2>GnuCash 2.5.3 (Unstable) released</h2>

<p>The GnuCash development team proudly announces GnuCash 2.5.3,
the fourth release in the 2.5.x series of the GnuCash
Free Accounting Software which will eventually lead to the stable
version 2.6.0. It runs on GNU/Linux, *BSD, Solaris and Mac OSX.</p>

<div class="dialog warning">
<p><b>WARNING:</b> This is an <b>UNSTABLE</b> version of Gnucash.</p>

<p>This release is intended for developers and testers who want to
help find bugs and other problems to make the eventual stable release
better.</p>

<p> Make sure you make backups of any files used in testing versions
of GnuCash in the 2.5.x series. Although the developers go to great
lengths to ensure that no data will be lost we cannot guarantee that
your data will not be affected if for some reason GnuCash crashes in
testing these releases.</p>

</div>

<div class="dialog note">
<p><b>NOTE:</b> The latest stable version is 2.4.13.</p>
</div>

<p>PLEASE TEST TEST AND TEST SOME MORE any and all features important to you.
Then post any bugs you find to bugzilla</p>
<h3>Major changes in the 2.5 series </h3>
<ul>

<li> Robert Fewell has contributed a rewrite of the register (Gnucash's
primary interface window) to use the GtkTreeModel (select "register 2"
from the menu) as well as a new CSV import/export facility for account
trees.<em>Take care not to try to open a single account in both the old and
new registers at the same time. Doing so will crash Gncuash</em></li>

<li> Gnucash now requires Gtk+-2.24 and GLib-2.26. We've removed most
 of the dependencies on libraries obsoleted by project Ridley and will
 be in position to move to Gtk+-3.x once the GtkTreeModel register
 window work is complete. This means that Gnucash 2.5 requires Debian
 6, RHEL 6, or one of the more aggressive distributions like
 Ubuntu.</li>

<li> Gnucash now works with Guile-2.0, but enabling Guile-2.0 support
requires building Gnucash with <a
href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/swig/swig-2.0.10.tar.gz">
Swig-2.0.10</a>. The distribution tarballs were built with Swig 2.0.9,
so they <em>do not</em> work with Guile-2.0. If you need Guile-2.0
support you will have to build Gnucash-2.5.3 from the repo after
installing Swig-2.0.10 on your system </li>

<li> The business module has been revamped and we introduce some new features:
     <ul>
     <li> Credit Notes </li>
     <li> Customer and Vendor Overview Pages</li>
     <li> Customer Overview Reports </li>
     <li> Existing Transactions may be reassigned as invoice payments </li>
     <li> Support for duplicate invoices </li>
     <li> Improved invoice and bill handling: Post, print, or duplicate
     multiple items directly from a search results list </li>
     <li> Better invoice printing setup: Choose a default invoice report as a
     preference </li>
     <li> Reorder invoice entries in the invoice window </li>
     </ul>
</li>
<li> The "Num" field is now optionally per-split rather than
 per-transaction.</li>

<li> Gnucash can print to a PDF for reports and invoices </li>
<li> Account "Filter By" settings can be saved and recalled </li>
<li> Account entries in the Chart of Account can be colored </li>
<li> When opening a locked "book" one now has the option of opening it
 read-only. Note that Gnucash is still a single-user program and that
 the database backends are still used only as a data store.</li>

<li>Tom Loft has contributed an initial version of REST API allowing minimal information about accounts, invoices and customers to be accessed in JSON format. Includes modifications to gnucash_core.py  to add additional functions.</li>

<li> Gnucash is no longer subject to the "2038" bug, so that 30-year
 mortgages can now be entered correctly.</li>

<li> By agreement of all authors we have relicensed Gnucash to the Gnu
 Public License Version 2 or later from just Version 2.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Changes Since the Last Unstable Release</h3>
<ul>
<li>Register Rewrite Update:

<ul>
<li>Better commodity/currency handling</li>
<li>Sanity checks when converting TreePaths</li>
<li>Posted dates now work like old register</li>
<li>Enable online actions in Register2</li>
</ul>
Author: Robert Fewell</li>
<li><p>Customized report settings have been redesigned so that it's no longer necessary to change the report's name to save it, multiple versions of the same report can be saved (the names are automatically numbered) using Save As, and saved reports can be easily updated by clicking Save.</p><p>Author: Geert Jansens</p></li>
<li>Faster versions of several reports by Peter Broadberry</li>
<li>It's now possible to post multiple invoices from the find
dialog. GnuCash was crashing if you searched for all unposted
invoices, selected two or more of them, and posted them.  This was
because the list of invoices to be posted changed while it was being
processed.  As part of fixing this the prompt for post date, due date,
etc. will only be given once, not once per invoice.</li>
<li>One can now reorder un-numbered transactions within a date by drag and drop or with arrow keys.</li>

<h3>Caveats for Testers</h3>
<p><b>Any 2.5.x version might crash unexpectedly.</b> If you must test
with important data in a 2.5.x release and are using the XML file
backend for data storage, be sure to save the file frequently. If you
are using the SQL backend, this is not required as every change is
saved immediately to the database.</p>

<p>Although the screenshots have been updated in the documentation,
much of the wording still describes Gnucash-2.4. Please help update
the documentation: See <a
href="http://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/Development">the development wiki
page</a> on how to get involved.</p>

<h3>How can you help?</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Testing:</b> Please try out as many features as you can. Report

<li><b>Translating:</b> Translators may begin work on new strings at any time,

September. Status of translations is shown on the <a
