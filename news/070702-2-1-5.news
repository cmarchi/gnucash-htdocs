<h2>GnuCash 2.1.5 released</h2>

<p>The GnuCash development team proudly announces GnuCash 2.1.5 aka "Release
Candidate 2", the second release candidate for the upcoming 2.2.0 stable release
of the GnuCash Free Accounting Software. With this new release series,
GnuCash is available on Microsoft Windows for the first time, and it also runs
on GNU/Linux, *BSD, Solaris and Mac OSX. This release is intended for developers
and testers who want to help tracking down all those bugs that are still in
there.</p>
<p><b>Data file notice</b>: In version 2.1.2 the format for scheduled
transactions in the data file was changed.  Files using the old format will be
read without problems by this new version, but the new version of GnuCash only
writes the new format.  The new file format cannot be loaded by older versions
of GnuCash.  (If you try, the file will fail to be loaded with an error
message.)  As a result, if you begin using the new Gnucash, and you have data
files with scheduled transactions, then these files will not be readable by
older versions.  If you have to make a new data file readable by older
versions of GnuCash, this can be achived by deleting all records of scheduled
transactions in the scheduled transaction editor.</p>
<p>Please test any and all features important to you. Then post any bugs
you find to <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=GnuCash"
