2009-08-29

<h2>GnuCash 2.3.5 released</h2>

<p>The GnuCash development team proudly announces GnuCash 2.3.5, the sixth of several unstable 2.3.x releases of the GnuCash Free Accounting Software which will eventually lead to the stable version 2.4.0. With this new release series, GnuCash can use an SQL database using SQLite3, MySQL or PostgreSQL. It runs on GNU/Linux, *BSD, Solaris, Microsoft Windows and Mac OSX. This release is intended for developers and testers who want to help tracking down all those bugs that are still in there.</p>
<p> WARNING WARNING WARNING - Make sure you make backups of any files used in testing versions of GnuCash in the 2.3.x series. Although the developers go to great lengths to ensure that no data will be lost we cannot guarantee that your data will not be affected if for some reason GnuCash crashes in testing these releases.</p>
<p>PLEASE TEST TEST AND TEST SOME MORE any and all features important to you.
Then post any bugs you find to bugzilla</p>
<p>Major changes in the 2.3.x release include;
<ul>
<li>In addition to the XML backend, Gnucash can now use a SQLite3, MySQL or PostgreSQL database to store the data. This is a new implementation using libdbi. It supports all features including the business features.  In order to build with this, add --enable-dbi to the configure command.  In addition to the libdbi-dev package for your distribution, you will also need the appropriate DBD (libdbi driver) package for sqlite3, mysql or postgresql.</li>
<li>In addition to the current GtkHTML HTML engine used to display reports and graphs, Gnucash can use WebKit. WebKit is the engine used by Google Chrome on Windows and Safari on Apple.  In order to build with this, add --enable-webkit to the configure command.  You will need an appropriate webkit-dev package.  On win32, you will need to download the webkit-1.1.5-win32.zip file from the source repository and put it into the downloads directory of your gnucash build area.</li>
<li>Updated to AqBanking 3 on Win32.</li>
</ul>

<p>Changes between 2.3.4 and 2.3.5 include:
<ul>
<li>Partly revert r18246: disable writing of "hidden" and "placeholder" so that XML files written by 2.3.5 can be read by 2.2.9</li>
<li>Avoid CRIT messages when loading root account which has NULL commodity</li>
<li>Fix compilation problem - add GPOINTER_TO_UINT() cast</li>
<li>Fix bug 592357: Cannot specify port for database connection.  You can now add a port number using ":<port>" (e.g. ":100") to the end of the host specification in the Open and Save As dialog for databases.</li>
<li>Fix bug 592021: Budget Report: Options to show actual, budgeted and diff don't work</li>
<li>Fix minor i18n issues. 1) Don't translate gtk stock button labels. 2) Don't split sentences when translating. 3) Exclude formatting from translatable messages when possible</li>
<li>Updated German translation</li>
<li>Fix bug 592719 - postgres backend aborts with date problems</li>
<li>Merge latest pot tempate into all .po translation files</li>
<li>Add win32 version of gmtime_r</li>
<li>Fix bug 575778: QIF import: fix crash when a security list omits the "T" (type) line</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Caveats for Testers</b></p>
<p>Any 2.3.x version might crash unexpectedly at any point during runtime. If you test some serious work in a 2.3.x release and are using the XML file backend for data storage, make sure you hit "Save" after every non-trivial workstep.  If you are using the SQL backend, this is not required as every change is saved immediately to the database.<p>
<p>The documentation has had screenshots updated, however, many help texts usually only refers to the 1.8.x series. Everyone is invited to help improve the documentation; see http://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/Development on how to get involved.</p>

<p><b>How can you help?</b></p>
<p>Testing: Test it and help us discover all bugs that might show up in there.  Please enter each and every bug into bugzilla.</p>
<p>Translating: The new release comes with some new translation strings. If you consider contributing a translation, we invite you to test this release already. A string freeze will be announced in one of the later 2.3.x releases.  Please check http://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/Translation_Status for updates on this.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We would like to encourage people to test this and any further releases as much as possible and submit bug reports in order that we can polish GnuCash to be as stable as possible for the 2.4.0 release in a few weeks. Then post any bugs you find to <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=GnuCash">bugzilla</a></p>
