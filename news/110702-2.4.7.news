When using trading accounts, the exchange rate dialog has a slightly
different behavior. This patch fixes the behavior for transactions
that are created in-line and are not expanded (single-line).
It does not affect the expanded transactions or transactions created
in the new transaction dialog.

are not working</li>
<li>[20750] Windows build: change default gtk theme to work around a number of
problems in the Ms-Windows theme we used before.
Particularly, this prevents the crash caused by bug #614636 and fixes
the black notebook tabs that appeared after Phil upgraded webkit and
many related gnome dependencies.
The new default theme is "Nimbus" following a suggestion by Kim Wood
on the mailing list.</li>
