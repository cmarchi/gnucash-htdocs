<p>Personal and small business accounting in GNU/Linux will be easier and better
after today's release of GnuCash 2.0.5.</p>
<p>This release of the free, open source accounting program improves on the
generational advances in the last version. GnuCash 2.0 is based on

<li>Fix security problem with tmp filesystem and symlink attack.</li>
<li>Add French and Canadian French translation updates.</li>
<li>Do not crash on delete_event in new user dialog.</li>
<li>Add sanity checks when accessing GncPluginPage.</li>
<li>Make new windows the same size as the active one.</li>
</ul>

<p>The GnuCash development team said these new features and changes will make
GnuCash easier than ever for newcomers.</p>
<p>GnuCash is the leading free, open source accounting program and the leap to gtk2
will enable users to be able to enjoy cutting edge functionality with the
freedom of not being locked into proprietory file formats.</p>
<p><b>Playing With Others</b></p>
<p>As with other leading GNU/Linux software that is designed to replace
proprietory programs, GnuCash is a functional
replacement for expensive accounting programs.  Like OpenOffice.org and
The Gimp, GnuCash is also programmed to communicate and interact with as many
existing programs, institutions and people as possible.</p>
<p>The GnuCash development team has continued to improve file import filters,
which allow users to import work from old programs like Microsoft Money and
Quicken.  GnuCash can load QIF and QFX files, which are used by both of those
programs.</p>
<p>Developers have also continued to incorporate support for online banking into
the program.  GnuCash 2.0 supports OFX DirectConnect which can directly
retrieve and import account statements over the Internet.</p>
<p>Ths release is available in 29 languages, including English,
French, German, Spanish, Norwegian, so people from around the world will have
no difficulty operating the program</p>
<p><b>Off on the Right Foot</b></p>
<p>Users of GnuCash 2.0 will notice a few changes when they start the
program.  Improvements have been made on startup speed, scheduled
transactions, currency support and currency quote retrievals.</p>
<p>After they enter the program, users will find a double-ledger account
system, exhaustive report options and account hierarchy tools.  Also at their
disposal is a full system of tutorials and documentation.</p>
<p><b>Getting GnuCash</b></p>
<p>GnuCash 2.0 can be downloaded from sourceforge.net.  It is available as
source code.</p>
<p>To install GnuCash, users will need Gnome 2, guile, slib and
g-wrap.</p>
