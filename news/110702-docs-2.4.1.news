 </li>


  <li>Markup releated changes
  <ul>
    <li>Delete guilabel tags below section titles with same wording (redundant).<br>

    <li>Define entities for current stable and unstable versions, patch by Yawar Amin</li>
    <li>guide: Add entities for stable and unstable series<br>

    Sometimes referring to the exact version in the documentation is a bit
    superfluous, and instead we just want to refer to general GnuCash release
    series (2.2, 2.3, 2.4, etc.) in which something happened.</li>
    <li>Add mdash entity to enable the use of xml2po and add description for entities.</li>
    <li>Add guibutton tag.</li>
    <li>Generate html doc in UTF-8 instead of ISO-8859-1</li>
    <li>Add figure tags and pgwide attribute to some screenshots<br>
    The figure tags should go around all screenshots to have them
    show up in the list of figures.<br>
    The pgwide attribute repositions the image in pdf documents. Large
    pictures still fit on the page thanks to this flag.</li>
    <li>Use different accounting equation image for html or pdf rendering
    This is meant as an example of how the pdf images can be improved.
    This may not work well for screenshots though.</li>
    <li>Improve figures and images for pdf printing and remove unused ones.
    Change ppi to 144 for all figures</li>
    <li>Add hyperlink to GnuCash user list.</li>

    <li>Restore pdf creation for gnucash-guide and gnucash-help in all languages.</li>
    <li>Update docbook specification from 4.1.2 to 4.4.</li>
    <li>Migrate the Italian GnuCash guide to a po file based workflow.</li>
    <li>Set svn:eol-style property for all XML files to LF to avoid CRLF/LF mixups.</li>
    <li>More information on translation process</li>
    <li>Several other small fixes and tweaks in the documentation build system</li>
 </ul>
