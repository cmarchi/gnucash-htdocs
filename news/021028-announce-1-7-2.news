This release features HBCI online banking support. This makes it the
world's first *free* HBCI-enabled personal finance manager.

HBCI (Home Banking Computer Interface) is a standard used by German
banks for offering online banking service. Through this standard,
business actions like statement retrieval, bank transfer, or direct
debits can be invoked by any HBCI-compliant client application, i.e. now
also from GnuCash. Authentification and encryption is done through a
bank-issued chip card or a self-generated file-based RSA key pair. (In
the latter case, the user prints out his public key finger print on
paper, signs it, and sends it to his bank.)
