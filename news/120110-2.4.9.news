<h2>GnuCash 2.4.9 released</h2>

<p>The GnuCash development team proudly announces GnuCash 2.4.9, the eighth bug fix release in a series of stable of the GnuCash Free Accounting Software. With this release series, GnuCash can use an SQL database using SQLite3, MySQL or PostgreSQL. It runs on GNU/Linux, *BSD, Solaris, Microsoft Windows and Mac OSX.</p>

<h3>Getting GnuCash for Windows (Win32 binary)</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/gnucash/gnucash-2.4.9-setup.exe">Gnucash 2.4.9 Win32 setup executable</a> can be downloaded from Sourceforge. It will install everything needed to run GnuCash.</p>

<h3>Mac OSX binary</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/gnucash/Gnucash-Intel-2.4.9.dmg">Gnucash 2.4.9 MacOSX package</a> can be downloaded from Sourceforge as well.</p>

<h3>Getting GnuCash as source code</h3>
<p>If you want to compile GnuCash 2.4.9 for yourself, the source code can be downloaded from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sourceforge: <a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/gnucash/gnucash-2.4.9.tar.bz2">bzip2</a>, <a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/gnucash/gnucash-2.4.9.tar.gz">gzip</a>, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnucash/files/gnucash%20(stable)/2.4.9/">all files</a>.</li>
<li>You can also checkout the sources directly from the subversion repository as <a href="http://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/Subversion">described here.</a></li>
</ul>

<p>To compile GnuCash from the source code by yourself, you will need Gnome 2, guile, slib. In addition you will need swig if compiling from subversion.</p>

<h3>Changes</h3>

<p>The headline change is for Microsoft Windows(TM) users: The underlying versions of Gtk+, Guile, and AQBanking (along with some dependencies) have been updated so that a separate GUI library (Qt) is no longer needed for AQBanking and those users can finally have the features of AQBanking5 which have been available to Linux and Mac users since 2.4.0.

<p>Between 2.4.8 and 2.4.9, the following bugfixes were included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bug #666329 Empty database after a little while

Separate the two uses of QofBook::dirty -- indicating that the book object
itself has been edited and indicating that some object in the dataset has
been changed -- into two separate variables with separate getters &amp; setters.

Use gnc_dbi_safe_sync_all (which doesn't lose data if the save partion
errors out) for all be-&gt;sync.

Reverse qof_book_mark_saved and qof_instance_mark_clean so that the book
is dirty for qof_book_mark_saved when it's the instance.
