The GnuCash development team proudly announces GnuCash 1.9.5 aka 
"The final countdown begins", the sixth of several unstable 1.9.x
releases of the GnuCash Open Source Accounting Software which will eventually
lead to the stable version 2.0.0. This release contains many bugfixes since
the fifth release but is still only intended for developers and adventurous
testers who want to help tracking down bugs.


<h2>What's New in GnuCash 1.9.5?</h2>

<p>o WARNING WARNING WARNING - Make sure you make backups of any files
  used in testing versions of GnuCash in the 1.9.x series. Although the
  developers go to great lengths to ensure that no data will be lost we
  cannot guarantee that your data will not be affected if for some
  reason GnuCash crashes in testing these releases.</p>
<p>o PLEASE TEST TEST AND TEST SOME MORE any and all features important
  to you. Then post any bugs you find to bugzilla
  http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=GnuCash</p>
<p>o If you have the urge to help beyond testing please get involved in
  the discussions on the GnuCash mailing lists which you will find at
  http://www.gnucash.org. We especially need people to help with

  series. Please see http://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/Development on how to
  get involved.</p>

<h2> Caveats </h2>
<p>Caveats for testers:
</p>
<ul><li> Any 1.9.x version might <i>crash unexpectedly at any point</i> during
runtime. If you test some serious work in a 1.9.x release, make sure you hit
"Save" after ever non-trivial workstep.
</li><li> Keep in mind that features which are not used in everyday work might
crash unexpectedly at all times. This includes but is not limited to:
graphical reports, scheduled transaction editor, price editor, financial
calculator, OFX/QIF/HBCI import.
</li><li> Especially all the <i>new features</i> might crash instantly on
testing. This applies in particular to any of the budget-related features. We
may always decide to disable such new features for the initial 2.0.0 release,
and re-enable them in a later release.
</li><li> The <i>documentation is completely outdated</i>. All help texts
usually only refer to the 1.8.x series; please expect all descriptions in the
help texts to be totally wrong when applied to the upcoming 1.9.x series.
Everyone is invited to help improve the documentation; see <a
