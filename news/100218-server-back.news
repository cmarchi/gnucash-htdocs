<h2>GnuCash Services Back Online</h2>

<p>As of 2am EST on Thursday, February 18 all GnuCash services should be up and running normally.  Over the next few days there may be brief outages as equipment is rearranged or routing preferences are fixed.  But the services themselves (Email, Subversion, Wiki, etc) should be accessible.</p>

<p>Thank you for your patience</p>
