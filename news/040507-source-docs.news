<b>Source Code Documentation</b> 
2004-05-07   13:22:28

A decent set of source code documentation can be generated 
by using 
<a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/">Doxygen</a>.
We've cleaned up the core engine documentation
<a href="https://cvs.gnucash.org/docs/HEAD/modules.html">and 
put it online</a>.  We hope you are sutably impressed.

(Note there are additional developer docs in plain text and 
in texinfo formats.  What's online are just the Doxygen docs 
generated from what's embedded in the source.)
