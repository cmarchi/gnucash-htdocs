<b>Translators Needed!</b> 
2002-12-17   20:00:41

The next stable release, 1.8.0, is rapidly approaching, and we need
all language translators to update the message catalogs. 
Version 1.8.0 will be based on the development versions 1.7.x,
which contain many new features not in 1.6.x, and thus many
new strings that need translation.
If these translations are not brought up to date, version 1.8.0
will come out with broken or missing translations for many languages.
Now is really the best time to bring translations up to date.
