After over a month of server problems I think we have things worked out.  I still need to setup mailing list archives.  Also ftp.gnucash.org points to the wrong IP, this is already fixed and just needs to get refreshed in your DNS! =)

In addition anyone who was having difficulty subscribing to the mailing list should try again.  Keep in mind that we have change mailing list managers and the process for subscribing is different.  Read the section "Mailing List - Help" for more information!
