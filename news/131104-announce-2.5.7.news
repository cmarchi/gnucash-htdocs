<p>The GnuCash development team proudly announces GnuCash 2.5.7,

<div class="dialog warning">
<p><b>WARNING:</b> This is an <b>UNSTABLE</b> version of GnuCash.</p>

of GnuCash in the 2.5.x series. Although the developers go to great
lengths to ensure that no data will be lost we cannot guarantee that
your data will not be affected if for some reason GnuCash crashes in
testing these releases.</p>

<h3>Major changes in the 2.5 series </h3>

<ul>
  <li> Register2 is now a configure option. Default builds, including
  the Windows and Mac All-in-one packages, will use only the old
  register. We've decided that it isn't ready for general use and the
  principal author doesn't have time to make it ready in time for a
  2.6 release.</li>


  <li> GnuCash now requires Gtk+-2.24 and GLib-2.26. We've removed most
  of the dependencies on libraries obsoleted by project Ridley and will
  be in position to move to Gtk+-3.x once the GtkTreeModel register
  window work is complete. This means that GnuCash 2.5 requires Debian
  6, RHEL 6, or one of the more aggressive distributions like
  Ubuntu.</li>

  <li> GnuCash now works with Guile-2.0, but enabling Guile-2.0 support
  requires building GnuCash with <a
  href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/swig/swig-2.0.10.tar.gz">
  Swig-2.0.10</a>. The distribution tarballs were built with this version and should work with Guile-2.0</li>

  <li> The business module has been revamped and we introduce some new features:
     <ul>
       <li> Credit Notes </li>
       <li> Customer and Vendor Overview Pages</li>
       <li> Customer Overview Reports </li>
       <li> Existing Transactions may be reassigned as invoice payments </li>
       <li> Support for duplicate invoices </li>
       <li> Improved invoice and bill handling: Post, print, or duplicate
       multiple items directly from a search results list </li>
       <li> Better invoice printing setup: Choose a default invoice report as a
       preference </li>
       <li> Reorder invoice entries in the invoice window </li>
     </ul>
  </li>

  <li><p>Geert Janssens has rewritten the preferences system to use
	 GSettings from GIO (GLib) instead of GConf. This is a simpler
	 and more robust backend which writes to the OS's native prefs
	 &mdash; defaults on OS X and the Registry on MSWindows &mdash; and
	 allows us to remove several troublesome dependencies
	 including GConf, ORBit, and DBus.</p>

	 <p><em><b>WARNING: Preferences are not completely migrated
	 from GConf</b></em> <br/>Some preferences are not yet
	 migrated. What's more, the migration occurs every time you
	 start up, over-writing anything that you've changed, so you
	 may want to move ~/.gconf aside after the first time you run
	 GnuCash-2.5.7. You can move it back when you need to use
	 2.4.13 for real work.</p> </li>

  <li> The "Num" field is now optionally per-split rather than
  per-transaction.</li>

  <li> GnuCash can print to a PDF for reports and invoices </li>

  <li> Account "Filter By" settings can be saved and recalled </li>

  <li> Account entries in the Chart of Account can be colored </li>

  <li> When opening a locked "book" one now has the option of opening it
  read-only. Note that GnuCash is still a single-user program and that
  the database backends are still used only as a data store.</li>

  <li>Tom Loft has contributed an initial version of REST API allowing
  minimal information about accounts, invoices and customers to be
  accessed in JSON format. Includes modifications to gnucash_core.py
  to add additional functions.</li>

  <li> GnuCash is no longer subject to the "2038" bug, so that 30-year
  mortgages can now be entered correctly.</li>

  <li> Frédéric Perrin has contributed a change to display currency
  symbols whenever they are known and unambiguous.</li>

  <li> By agreement of all authors we have relicensed GnuCash to the Gnu
  Public License Version 2 or later from just Version 2.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Changes Since the Last Unstable Release</h3>

<h3>Caveats for Testers</h3>
<p><b>Any 2.5.x version might crash unexpectedly.</b> If you must test
with important data in a 2.5.x release and are using the XML file
backend for data storage, be sure to save the file frequently. If you
are using the SQL backend, this is not required as every change is
saved immediately to the database.</p>

<p>Although the screenshots have been updated in the documentation,
much of the wording still describes GnuCash-2.4. Please help update
the documentation: See <a
href="http://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/Development">the development wiki
page</a> on how to get involved.</p>

<h3>How can you help?</h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>Testing:</b> Please try out as many features as you can. Report
  problems either in <a

  reports</a>or on the <a
  href="https://lists.gnucash.org/mailman/listinfo/gnucash-devel">devel
  mailing list</a></li>

  <li><b>Translating:</b> Translators may begin work on new strings at any time,
  though string freeze isn't planned until the 2.5.7 release in early
  September. Status of translations is shown on the <a
  href="http://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/Translation_Status">translation
  status </a> page. If GnuCash isn't fully translated into your language
  and you'd like to pitch in, <a
