    - Remove Yawar's e-mail adress from the author's listing (on his request)

    This is a follow up on r22373 which fixes the help file locations
    for newer yelp versions. That fix was incompatible with older
    yelp versions. With the links in place, both old and new yelp
    versions should properly find the help files.

    It is expected that the older yelp versions won't be used anymore
    by the time the current trunk gets stable.</li>
