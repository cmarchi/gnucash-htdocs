<p>The GnuCash development team proudly announces GnuCash 2.4.6, the sixth bug fix release in a series of stable of the GnuCash Free Accounting Software. With this release series, GnuCash can use an SQL database using SQLite3, MySQL or PostgreSQL. It runs on GNU/Linux, *BSD, Solaris, Microsoft Windows and Mac OSX.</p>

<h3>Getting GnuCash for Windows (Win32 binary)</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/gnucash/gnucash-2.4.6-setup.exe">Gnucash 2.4.6 Win32 setup executable</a> can be downloaded from Sourceforge. It will install everything needed to run GnuCash.

<h3>Mac OSX binary</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/gnucash/Gnucash-Intel-2.4.6.dmg">Gnucash 2.4.6 MacOSX package</a> can be downloaded from Sourceforge as well.

<h3>Getting GnuCash as source code</h3>
<p>If you want to compile GnuCash 2.4.6 for yourself, the source code can be downloaded from:
<ul>
<li>Sourceforge: <a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/gnucash/gnucash-2.4.6.tar.bz2">bzip2</a>, <a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/gnucash/gnucash-2.4.6.tar.gz">gzip</a>, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnucash/files/gnucash%20(stable)/2.4.6/">all files</a>.</li>
<li>You can also checkout the sources directly from the subversion repository as <a href="http://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/Subversion">described here.</a></li>
</ul></p>

<p>To compile GnuCash from the source code by yourself, you will need Gnome 2, guile, slib. In addition you will need swig if compiling from subversion.</p>

<h3>Changes</h3>

<p>Between 2.4.5 and 2.4.6, the following bugfixes were included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preserve selection around the call to gtk_editable_set_position.
This lets us drop the racy gnucash_sheet_select_data_cb, which fixes
problems with lost input.</li>
<li>Add a gnc_quartz_set_menu call to main_window_new() so that newly
created windows get their menus on the mac menu.</li>
<li>Fix up the Mac shutdown process to give Gnucash a chance to clean up without spewing critical errors about the main loop already running (because of calling gnc_shutdown in an event handler).</li>

<li>Bug #650241: Fix style for aging table in owner reports that has changed (after defining doctype)
Prevent inheriting the parent tablestyle for aging table in owner-report.</li>
<li>Bug #650757: Fix Easy &amp; footer styles output wrong tags &lt;/btd&gt; iso &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt; preventing HTML 4.01 Transitional validation

This patch removes the wrong &lt;/btd&gt; tags and closes the center tag in the
footer and easy stylesheets.
</li>
<li>Bug #645221: Patch to show the headline as an h3 across all stylesheets

The attached patch makes sure that the title fonts set through the options menu
behaves consistently across all style sheets.
</li>
<li>Bug #620123: Patch to make account name a header cell, iso td in trial-balance</li>
<li>Bug #648554: SQL backend doesn't correctly save taxable flag on bills.
</li>
<li>Bug #650163: Fix Technicolor style that outputs wrong tags &lt;btd&gt; instead of &lt;b&gt;&lt;td&gt;
</li>
<li>Bug #650139: Fix missing doctype preventing HTML 4.01 transitional validation

Exported reports lack a document type, preventing HTML validation.

When exporting this may lead browsers to incorrectly read the reports generated
by GnuCash.
</li>
<li>Bug #650138: Style plain: Fix incorrect &lt;p&gt; tag around &lt;h3&gt; preventing HTML 4.01 transitional validation
</li>
<li>Bug #649992: Let owner-report aging table include due date / post date options in aging.
The attached patch patches the owner report to:
*Allow a choice between the use of Due Date and Date Posted
*Report with the current bucket</li>
<li>Bug #649608: Skip non-enabled Scheduled Transactions for Future Txn report</li>
<li>Update Slovak translation, copied from the Translation Project.</li>
<li>Bug #646729: Create the lockfile with at least read write user permissions
</li>
<li>Bug #647945: Add sanity check to hopefully fix crash when running custom reports </li>
<li>Bug #644897: Correctly link in libgncmod-report-gnome.la to avoid linking against an installed version.</li>
<li>Bug #646268: Fix missing GWEN_SYNCIO initialization.</li>
<li>Bug #644762: Deprecated __new__() call in function_class.py</li>
<li>Bug #647360: Invoice entries in expense voucher are created in old voucher, not in new one.
It worked fine for customer invoices, and vendor bills, but not
expense vouchers, where the feature was broken all along.</li>
<li>Bug #647242: Fix broken averaging for quarter or half-year step size
</li>
<li>Bug #647316: Fix crash when deleting custom report if no backup file existed.

Before deleting the backup file by (delete-file), it must be checked
whether the to-be-deleted file exists, otherwise the guile procedure
will crash.</li>
<li>Fix warning about NULL guid_list in xaccQueryAddAccountGUIDMatch, which caused some total amounts in reports to disappear.

Apparently gnc:account-get-trans-type-splits-interval didn't watch out
for empty lists of accounts, and the resulting split list somehow
was bogus. Now that we check for empty account list, all is fine again.
This was broken for some months by now, maybe since r20404?</li>
<li>Bug #628342 - Quick open on File menu deleted if failed</li>
<li>Bug #629156 Recently Used Filenames incorrectly displayed</li>
</ul>

<p>In 2.4.6, translations for Japanese language were updated.</p>
