Basic Accounting Concepts</h2></div></div><p>As we saw in the previous chapter, accounting is based on 5 basic
    account types: <b>Assets</b>,
    <b>Liabilities</b>, <b>Equity</b>,
    <b>Income</b> and <b>Expenses</b>. We will now
    expand on our understanding of these account types, and show how they are
    represented in GnuCash. But first, let's divide them into 2 groups, the
    balance sheet accounts and the income and expense accounts.</p><p>Lets have a quick look at the Accounting Equation (<b>Assets
    - Liabilities = Equity + (Income - Expenses)</b>) again as a
    reminder, before we go deeper into each account type.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="figures/basics_AccountRelationships.png" alt="The basic accounts relationships"><div class="caption"><p>A graphical view of the relationship between the 5 basic

          through expenses. The arrows represent the movement of value.</p></div></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="accts-bsa2"></a>3.1.1. Balance Sheet Accounts</h3></div></div><p>The three so-called <b>Balance Sheet Accounts</b>
      are <b>Assets</b>, <b>Liabilities</b>, and
      <b>Equity</b>. Balance Sheet Accounts are used to track
      the changes in value of things you own or owe.</p><p><b>Assets</b> is the group of things that you own.
      Your assets could include a car, cash, a house, stocks, or anything else
      that has convertible value. Convertible value means that theoretically
      you could sell the item for cash.</p><p><b>Liabilities</b> is the group of things on which
      you owe money. Your liabilities could include a car loan, a student
      loan, a mortgage, your investment margin account, or anything else which
      you must pay back at some time.</p><p><b>Equity</b> is the same as "net worth." It
      represents what is left over after you subtract your liabilities from
      your assets. It can be thought of as the portion of your assets that you
      own outright, without any debt.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="accts-ie2"></a>3.1.2. Income and Expense Accounts</h3></div></div><p>The two <b>Income and Expense Accounts</b> are used
      to increase or decrease the value of your accounts. Thus, while the
      balance sheet accounts simply <b>track</b> the value of
      the things you own or owe, income and expense accounts allow you to
      <b>change</b> the value of these accounts.</p><p><b>Income</b> is the payment you receive for your
      time, services you provide, or the use of your money. When you receive a
      paycheck, for example, that check is a payment for labor you provided to
      an employer. Other examples of income include commissions, tips,
      dividend income from stocks, and interest income from bank accounts.
      Income will always increase the value of your Assets and thus your
      Equity.</p><p><b>Expenses</b> refer to money you spend to purchase
      goods or services provided by someone else. Examples of expenses are a
      meal at a restaurant, rent, groceries, gas for your car, or tickets to
      see a play. Expenses will always decrease your Equity. If you pay for
      the expense immediately, you will decrease your Assets, whereas if you
      pay for the expense on credit you increase your Liabilities.</p></div></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" class="navfooter"><hr></hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="chapter_accts.html">&lt;&lt;&lt; Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="accts-types1.html">Next &gt;&gt;&gt;</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left">Chapter 3.
