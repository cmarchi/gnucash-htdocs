Setting Share Price</h2></div></div><p>The value of a commodity, such as a stock, must be explicitly set.
    The stock accounts track the quantity of stocks you own, but the value of
    the stock is stored in the <b>Price Editor</b>. The values
    set in the Price Editor can be updated manually or automatically.</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="invest-stockprice-initial2"></a>8.6.1. Initial Price Editor Setup</h3></div></div><p>To use the Price Editor to track a stock value, you must initially
      insert the stock. To do so, open the Price Editor
      (<b>Tools</b> -&gt; <b>Price Editor</b>) and
      click on Add button. The first time a
      Commodity/Stock is entered this window will be blank except for the
      control buttons on the bottom. Select the appropriate Commodity you want
      to insert into the Price Editor. At this point, you can input the price
      of the commodity manually. There are 5 fields in the New Commodity
      window:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p><b>Commodity</b> - the name of the commodity,
          must be chosen from the Select... list</p></li><li><p><b>Currency</b> - the currency in which the
          Price is expressed.</p></li><li><p><b>Date</b> - date that the price is
          valid</p></li><li><p><b>Type</b> - one of: <b>Bid</b>
          (the market buying price), <b>Ask</b> (the market
          selling price), <b>Last</b> (the last transaction
          price), <b>Net Asset Value</b> (mutual fund price per
          share), or <b>Unknown</b>. Stocks and currencies will
          usually give their quotes as one of bid, ask or last. Mutual funds
          are often given as net asset value. For other commodities, simply
          choose "Unknown". This option is for informational purposes only, it
          is not used by GnuCash.</p></li><li><p><b>Price</b> - the price of one unit of this
          commodity.</p></li></ul></div><p>As an example of adding the AMZN commodity to the price editor,
      with an initial value of $40.50 per share.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="figures/invest_peditor.png" alt="Price Editor"><div class="caption"><p>Adding the AMZN commodity to the price editor, with
          an initial value of $40.50 per share.</p></div></div></div><p>Click OK when finished. Once you have
      performed this initial placement of the commodity into the Price Editor,
      you will not have to do it again, even if you use the same commodity in
      another account.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="invest-stockprice-manual2"></a>8.6.2. Setting Stock Price Manually</h3></div></div><p>If the value of the commodity (stock) changes, you can adjust the
      value by entering the Price Editor, selecting the commodity, clicking on
      edit and entering the new price.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="figures/invest_peditor2.png" alt="Price Editor"><div class="caption"><p>The main price editor window, showing the list of all

      having to update their prices constantly. GnuCash has the ability to
      automatically download the most recent price for your commodities using
      the Internet. This is accomplished through the Perl module
      Finance::Quote, which must be installed in order to activate this
      feature.</p><p>To determine if the Perl module Finance::Quote is already
      installed on your system, type “perldoc Finance::Quote” in
      a terminal window and check to see if there is any documentation
      available. If you see the documentation, then the module is installed,
      if you do not see the documentation, then it has not been
      installed.</p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="invest-stockprice-auto-install3"></a>8.6.3.1. Installing Finance::Quote</h4></div></div><p>To install Finance::Quote begin by first closing any GnuCash
        applications you have running. Second, locate the folder where GnuCash
        is installed by searching for “gnc-fq-update” (without the quotes).
        Change to that directory, open a root shell and run the command
        “gnc-fq-update” (without the quotation marks). This will
        launch a Perl CPAN update session that will go out onto the Internet
        and install the Finance::Quote module on your system. The
        gnc-fq-update program is interactive, however, with most systems you
        should be able to answer “no” to the first question: “Are you
        ready for manual configuration? [yes]” and the update will
        continue automatically from that point.</p><p>After installation is complete, you should run the “gnc-fq-dump”
        test program, in the same directory, distributed with GnuCash to test
        if Finance::Quote is installed and working properly.</p><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img src="./stylesheet/note.png"></img></td><th align="left" valign="top">Note</th></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><p xmlns="">If you feel uncomfortable about performing any of these steps,
          please either email the GnuCash-user mailing list
          (gnucash-user@gnucash.org) for help or come to the GnuCash IRC
          channel on irc.gnome.org. You can also leave out this step and
          manually update your stock prices.</p></td></tr></table></div></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="invest-stockprice-auto-configure3"></a>8.6.3.2. Configuring Finance::Quote</h4></div></div><p>With Finance::Quote installed and functioning correctly, you
        must configure your GnuCash stock accounts to use this feature to
        obtain updated price information automatically. For stock accounts
        that have already been setup, edit the account
        and select the <b>Get On-line Quotes</b> box. You should
        now be able to modify the pop-up menus <b>The source for price
        quotes</b> and <b>The timezone for these
        quotes</b>. When finished editing the stock account, return to
        the price editor and click on the Get Quotes
        button to update your stock prices on the Internet.</p><p>The command “gnucash --add-price-quotes $HOME/gnucash-filename”
        can be used to fetch the current prices of your stocks.  The file specified
        “$HOME/gnucash-filename” will depend on the name and location of your
        data file.
        This can be determined by the name displayed in the top frame of the GnuCash window,
        before the “-”.  The file name can also be found “File -&gt;”
        “pull down list”, the first item, numbered 1, is the name of the currently
        open file.</p><p>This can be automated by creating a crontab entry. For example,
        to update your file every Friday evening (16:00) after the relevant exchange
        markets close (modify the time accordingly for your time zone), you could add
        the following to your personal crontab:</p><p>0 16 * * 5 gnucash --add-price-quotes $HOME/gnucash-filename &gt;
        /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1</p><p>Remember that Mutual Fund “prices” are really “Net Asset
        Value” and require several hours after the exchange closes before being
        available. If NAVs are downloaded before the current days NAVs are
        determined, yesterday's NAVs are retrieved.</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="invest-stockprice-view2"></a>8.6.4. Displaying Share Value</h3></div></div><p>The main account window, by default, only shows the quantity of
      each commodity that you own, under the column heading
      <b>Total</b>. In the case of stocks, this commodity is the
      number of shares. Often, however, you will want to see the value of your
      stocks expressed in terms of some monetary unit. This is easily
      accomplished by entering the main window, selecting the “Accounts” tab,
      by clicking on the title bar Options button (the small
      down pointing arrow on the right side of the main account window titles bar), and
      selecting the option to display the account total field “Total
      (USD)”. You will see a new column in the main window entitled
      <b>Total (USD)</b> that will express the value of all
      commodities in the report currency.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="figures/invest_stockvalue.png" alt="Viewing Stock Value"><div class="caption"><p>Viewing the value of a stock commodity in the main
