Basic Concepts</h2></div></div><p>This chapter will present some of the techniques used to keep track
    of the unrealized and realized gains and losses, better known as capital
    gains and losses.</p><p>Certain resellable assets can change value over time, such as
    stocks, bonds, houses, or cars. Some assets (eg: a stock) could increase
    in value, some (eg: a car) could decrease in value. It is important to be
    able to track some of these time-dependent asset valuations, this chapter
    will show you how.</p><p>Probably everything you own will increase or decrease in value over
    time. So, the question is for which of these assets should you track this
    changing value? The simple answer is that you only need to track this for
    items which could be sold for cash in the future or which relate to
    taxation.</p><p>Consumable and disposable items (eg: food, gas for your car, or
    printer paper) are obviously not involved. Thus, even though the new
    clothes you recently bought will certainly depreciate, you would not want
    to track this depreciation since you have no intention of reselling the
    clothes and there is no tax implications to the depreciation on clothing.
    So, for this example, the purchase of new clothes should be recorded as a
    pure expense... you spent the money, and it is gone.</p><p>Asset appreciation occurs when something you own increases in value
    over time. When you own an asset which has increased in value, the
    difference between the original purchase price and the new value is known
    as <b>unrealized gains</b>. When you sell the asset, the
    profit you earn is known as <b>realized gains</b> or
    <b>capital gains</b>. An example of an asset from which you
    could have unrealized gains, and eventually capital gains, is stock in a
    publicly traded company.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" class="navfooter"><hr></hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="chapter_capgain.html">&lt;&lt;&lt; Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="capgain_value1.html">Next &gt;&gt;&gt;</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left">Chapter 9.
