GnuCash Accounts</h2></div></div><p>This section will show how the GnuCash definition of an account fits
    into the view of the 5 basic accounting types.</p><p>But first, let's begin with a definition of an
    <b>account</b> in GnuCash. A GnuCash
    <b>account</b> is an entity which contains other
    sub-accounts, or that contains <b>transactions</b>. Since an
    account can contain other accounts, you often see <b>account
    trees</b> in GnuCash, in which logically associated accounts reside
    within a common parent account.</p><p>A GnuCash account must have a unique name (that you assign) and one
    of the predefined GnuCash "account types". There are a total of 12 account
    types in GnuCash. These 12 account types are based on the 5 basic
    accounting types, the reason there are more GnuCash account types than
    basic accounting types is that this allows GnuCash to perform specialized
    tracking and handling of certain accounts. There are 6 asset accounts
    (<b>Cash</b>, <b>Bank</b>,
    <b>Stock</b>, <b>Mutual Fund</b>,
    <b>Accounts Receivable</b>, and <b>Asset</b>
    ), 3 liability accounts (<b>Credit Card</b>,
    <b>Accounts Payable</b>, and <b>Liability</b>,
    ), 1 equity account (<b>Equity</b>), 1 income account
    (<b>Income</b>), and 1 expense account
    (<b>Expense</b>).</p><p>These GnuCash account types are presented in more detail
    below.</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="accts-gc-bsa2"></a>3.2.1. Balance Sheet Accounts</h3></div></div><p>The first balance sheet account we will examine is
      <b>Assets</b>, which, as you remember from the previous
      section, refers to things you own.</p><p>To help you organize your asset accounts and to simplify
      transaction entry, GnuCash supports several types of asset
      accounts:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><b>Cash</b> Use this account to track the money
          you have on hand, in your wallet, in your piggy bank, under your
          mattress, or wherever you choose to keep it handy. This is the most
          <b>liquid</b>, or easily traded, type of asset.</p></li><li><p><b>Bank</b> This account is used to track your
          cash balance that you keep in institutions such as banks, credit
          unions, savings and loan, or brokerage firms - wherever someone else
          safeguards your money. This is the second most
          <b>liquid</b> type of account, because you can easily
          convert it to cash on hand.</p></li><li><p><b>Stock</b> Track your individual stocks and
          bonds using this type of account. The stock account's register
          provides extra columns for entering number of shares and price of
          your investment. With these types of assets, you may not be able to
          easily convert them to cash unless you can find a buyer, and you are
          not guaranteed to get the same amount of cash you paid for
          them.</p></li><li><p><b>Mutual Fund</b> This is similar to the stock
          account, except that it is used to track funds. Its account register
          provides the same extra columns for entering share and price
          information. Funds represent ownership shares of a variety of
          investments, and like stocks they do not offer any guaranteed cash
          value.</p></li><li><p><b>Accounts Receivable</b> (A/Receivable) This
          is typically a business use only account in which you place
          outstanding debts owed to you. It is considered an asset because you
          should be able to count in these funds arriving.</p></li><li><p><b>Asset</b> For personal finances, use this
          type of account to track "big-ticket" item purchases that
          significantly impact your net worth. Generally, you can think of
          these as things you insure, such as a house, vehicles, jewelry, and
          other expensive belongings.</p></li></ol></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img src="./stylesheet/tip.png"></img></td><th align="left" valign="top">Tip</th></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><p xmlns="">For all GnuCash asset accounts, a <b>debit</b>
        (left-column value entry) increases the account balance and a
        <b>credit</b> (right-column value entry) decreases the
        balance. (See note later in this chapter.)</p></td></tr></table></div><p>The second balance sheet account is
      <b>Liabilities</b>, which as you recall, refers to what
      you owe, money you have borrowed and are obligated to pay back some day.
      These represent the rights of your lenders to obtain repayment from you.
      Tracking the liability balances lets you know how much debt you have at
      a given point in time.</p><p>GnuCash offers three liability account types:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><b>Credit Card</b> Use this to track your credit
          card receipts and reconcile your credit card statements. Credit
          cards represent a short-term loan that you are obligated to repay to
          the credit card company. This type of account can also be used for
          other short-term loans such as a line of credit from your
          bank.</p></li><li><p><b>Accounts Payable</b> (A/Payable) This is
          typically a business use only account in which you place bills you
          have yet to pay.</p></li><li><p><b>Liability</b> Use this type of account for
          all other loans, generally larger long-term loans such as a mortgage
          or vehicle loan. This account can help you keep track of how much
          you owe and how much you have already repaid.</p></li></ol></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img src="./stylesheet/tip.png"></img></td><th align="left" valign="top">Tip</th></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><p xmlns="">Liabilities in accounting act in an opposite manner from assets:
        <b>credits</b> (right-column value entries) increase
        liability account balances and <b>debits</b>
        (left-column value entries) decrease them. (See note later in this
        chapter)</p></td></tr></table></div><p>The final balance sheet account is <b>Equity</b>,
      which is synonymous with "net worth". It represents what is left over
      after you subtract your liabilities from your assets, so it is the
      portion of your assets that you own outright, without any debt. In
      GnuCash, use this type of account as the source of your opening bank
      balances, because these balances represent your beginning net
      worth.</p><p>There is only a single GnuCash equity account, called naturally
      enough, <b>Equity</b>.</p><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img src="./stylesheet/tip.png"></img></td><th align="left" valign="top">Tip</th></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><p xmlns="">In equity accounts, credits increase account balances and debits

        credits represent money transferred

        accounts, when you transfer money <b>from</b> (credit)
        the income account to another account, the balance of the income
        account <b>increases</b>. For example, when you deposit
        a paycheck and record the transaction as a transfer from an income
        account to a bank account, the balances of both accounts

        Contrary to popular belief and even some dictionary definitions,
        accounting debits and credits do not mean decrease and increase. The
        only constant definition of debits and credits is that debits are
        left-column entries and credits are right-column entries. In fact,
        debits and credits each increase certain types of accounts and
        decrease others. In asset and expense type accounts, debits increase
        the balance and credits decrease the balance. In liability, equity and
        income type accounts, credits increase the balance and debits decrease
        the balance.</p><p xmlns="">For example, debits <b>increase</b> your bank
        account balance and credits <b>decrease</b> your bank
        account balance. Wait a minute, you might say, a
        <b>debit</b> card <b>decreases</b> the
        balance in my checking account, because I take money out of it. And
        when the bank gives me money back on something, they
        <b>credit</b> my account. So why is this reversed in
        accounting?</p><p xmlns="">Banks report transactions from <b>their</b>
        perspective, not yours. Their perspective is exactly opposite to
        yours. To you, your bank account represents an asset, something you
        own. To the bank, your bank account represents a loan, or liability,
        because they owe you that money. As explained in this chapter, asset
        and liability accounts are exact opposites in the way they behave. In
        a liability account, debits <b>decrease</b> the balance
        and credits <b>increase</b> the balance.</p><p xmlns="">When you take money out of your bank account, the balance in
        your account decreases. To you, this is a decrease in an asset, so you
        <b>credit</b> your bank account. To the bank, this is a
        decrease in a liability, so they <b>debit</b> your bank
        account.</p></td></tr></table></div></div></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" class="navfooter"><hr></hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="accts-concepts1.html">&lt;&lt;&lt; Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="accts-examples1.html">Next &gt;&gt;&gt;</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left">3.1.
