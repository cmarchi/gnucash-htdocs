Splits and Mergers</h2></div></div><p>Companies may split their stock for many reasons but the most common
    is that the price has risen higher than management thinks is a reasonable price for
    many investors. Some of these splits are simple exchanges (eg 2 for 1 or 3 for 2)
    and some are complex exchanges with cash distributions.  Splits may also result in
    fewer shares if the exchange rate is a reverse split (1 for 3 or .75 for 1).

      with AT&amp;T. For this example you will have purchased AT&amp;T on April 1, 2005, any
      dividends will have been paid in cash, therefore not entered into the AT&amp;T
      stock register. </p><p> The conditions of the merger were .77942 share of SBC stock were exchanged for
      each share of AT&amp;T stock.  The merged company continued to use the symbol
      “T” from AT&amp;T.</p><p>AT&amp;T paid a “dividend” of $1.20/share on the transaction date,
      however this will not appear in the stock account as it was a cash distribution.</p><p>The process for entering this transaction is identical to the simple split until
      the “Details” screen.  You will need to create an split entry in each
      <b>Investment Account:Stock</b> account combination that has shares
      splitting.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="figures/invest_merge2.png" alt="An image of the stock split druid at step 2. "><div class="caption"><p>An image of the stock split druid at step 2 - Selection of
