Setting up Accounts</h2></div></div><p>The first step in managing your checkbook is to set up the necessary
    accounts. You can either use the default GnuCash accounts or set up your
    own. For more detail on how to set up a new account, refer to 
    <a href="accts-examples1.html#accts-examples-toplevel2" title="3.3.2. The Basic Top Level Accounts">The Basic Top Level Accounts</a>.
    For instructions on importing your accounts from another program, refer to
    <a href="basics-import1.html" title="2.7. Importing QIF Files">Importing QIF Files</a>.</p><p>Let's start with the bank accounts you'll need. You need one GnuCash
    bank type account for each physical bank account you wish to track. If you
    are setting up your own accounts or using the default GnuCash accounts,
    make sure that you have an opening balance transaction for each bank
    account you own. The easiest way to get this number is to use the balance
    from your last bank statement as your opening balance. You can enter this
    in the account information window automatically as part of the
    <b>New Account Hierarchy Setup</b> druid, or you can enter a
    manual transaction directly in the account. To enter the transaction
    manually, enter a transfer from an <b>Opening Balances</b>
    account (type equity) to the bank account.</p><p>The typical bank accounts you might track include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p>Checking - any institutional account that provides check-writing
        privileges.</p></li><li><p>Savings - an interest-bearing institutional account usually used
        to hold money for a longer term than checking accounts.</p></li></ul></div><p>Common transactions that affect these bank accounts are payments and
    deposits. <b>Payments</b> are transfers of money out of the
    bank account, usually to an expense account. <b>Deposits</b>
    are transfers of money into the bank account, usually from an income
    account. You will need to set up income and expense accounts to track
    where that money comes from and where it goes. Remember that a balanced
    transaction requires a transfer of an equal sum of money from at least one
    account to at least one other account. So if you deposit money in your
    checking account, you must also enter the account that money comes from.
    If you pay a bill from your checking account, you must also enter the
    account where that money goes.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" class="navfooter"><hr></hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="chapter_cbook.html">&lt;&lt;&lt; Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="cbook-deposits1.html">Next &gt;&gt;&gt;</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left">Chapter 5.
