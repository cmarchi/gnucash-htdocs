The GnuCash Interface</h2></div></div><p>The very first time you open GnuCash, you will see the
    <b>Welcome to GnuCash!</b> dialog. From there, GnuCash
    provides other tools to help you easily find what you are looking for.
    Let's take a look at some of the common screens and dialog boxes you will
    see.</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="basics-setup2"></a>2.3.1. Create a new set of accounts</h3></div></div><p>The <b>New Account Hierarchy Setup</b> druid allows
      you to create several accounts at once. When you open GnuCash the first
      time, you will get this dialog:</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="figures/basics_NewAccountHierarchySetup.png" alt="The New Account Hierarchy Setup Druid"><div class="caption"><p>This image shows the first screen of the <b>New
            Account Hierarchy Setup</b> Druid.</p></div></div></div><p>Click Next and follow the instructions
      provided in the dialog. The dialog provbasics-prefs1ides a default set of accounts
      with predefined account types, and you simply select the accounts you
      want. For more information on account types, see 
      <a href="accts-types1.html" title="3.2. GnuCash Accounts">GnuCash Accounts</a>.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="figures/basics_NewAccountHierarchySetup_currency.png" alt="The New Account Hierarchy Setup Druid - Currency"><div class="caption"><p>This image shows the second screen of the <b>New

            <b>Opening Balance</b>.</p></div></div></div><p>In this dialog you will be able to set an <b>Opening
      Balance</b> on each of the accounts, as well as indicate if it
      the account should be a <b>Placeholder</b> (only
      sub-accounts allowed, no transactions. Like Current Assets in above
      image)</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="figures/basics_NewAccountHierarchySetup_Finish.png" alt="The New Account Hierarchy Setup Druid - Finish"><div class="caption"><p>This image shows the Last screen of the <b>New
            Account Hierarchy Setup</b> Druid.</p></div></div></div><p>Click Apply to create all the accounts and
      leave the druid.</p><p>If you intend to import your data from another program and you
      want to keep the same account names you used in that program, you may
      want to delay setting up default accounts at this time. You can simply
      import the data and the account names into GnuCash from the other
      program (<a href="basics-import1.html" title="2.7. Importing QIF Files">Importing QIF Files</a> explains how to do this).</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="basics-tip2"></a>2.3.2. Tip of the Day</h3></div></div><p>GnuCash provides a <b>Tip of the Day</b> dialog to
      give helpful hints for using the program:</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="figures/basics_TipOfDay.png" alt="The Tip of the Day"><div class="caption"><p>This image shows the <b>Tip of the
            Day</b>.</p></div></div></div><p>These tips provide useful information for beginning users. To view
      more of the tips, click Next to continue. If you
      do not wish to see this dialog box on start-up, deselect the box next to
      <b>Display this dialog next time</b>. When you have
      finished viewing the helpful tips, click Close to
      close the Tip dialog.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="basics-main2"></a>2.3.3. Account Tree Window</h3></div></div><p>You should now see the <b>Accounts</b> window, which
      appears as shown below. The exact layout of the account tree will depend
      on which default accounts you selected during the New Account Hierarchy
      Setup. In this example, the "Common Accounts" are shown.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="figures/basics_Accounts.png" alt="The Account Tree Window"><div class="caption"><p>This image shows the <b>Accounts</b>
            window.</p></div></div></div><p>The Account Tree window provides an overview of the data contained
      in the current file. It contains a list of account names and their
      current balances. From this window, you can open any of the accounts.
      The individual account windows are called account registers. GnuCash
      allows you to have as many account registers open as you wish.</p><p>At the top of this window is the title bar, which displays the
      file name (once you have saved the file.) Below that is the menu bar.
      You can access the menu options by either clicking on these menu
      headings or by using shortcuts and access key combinations, covered
      later in this chapter. Next is the tool bar, which contains buttons
      for the most common functions.</p><p>The account tree appears below the tool bar. Once you have
      started creating accounts, the account names will appear in the account
      tree. You can customize which headings show up by using the
      small down-arrow at the far right just above the account tree.</p><p>At the bottom is the status bar, which tells you
      information about what you own (Net Assets) and how much money you have
      made (Profits).</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="basics-register2"></a>2.3.4. Account Register Window</h3></div></div><p>The Account Register windows are used to enter and edit your
      account data. As the name suggests, they look similar to a checkbook
      register. When you double-click an account name in the
      <b>Accounts</b> window, the <b>Register</b>
      window for that account will open.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="figures/basics_CheckAccount.png" alt="The Checking Account Register"><div class="caption"><p>This image shows The <b>Checking Account - Register
            </b> with several transactions.</p></div></div></div><p><a href="chapter_txns.html" title="Chapter 4. Transactions">Chapter 4</a> explains more about account 
      register windows and how to
      enter data into them. For now, note that the parts of an account
      register window are similar to the parts of the account tree window
      described earlier. The title bar at the top contains the account name.
      Below that, the menu bar contains menu options related to the account
      register. Tool bar buttons simplify common data entry functions. The
      status bar at the bottom of the window, displays some account balances
      covered in <a href="chapter_txns.html" title="Chapter 4. Transactions">Chapter 4</a>. At the bottom of the 
      account register window,
      information appears about the current location of the cursor.</p><p>You can resize the various columns that GnuCash display, but keep
      in mind that the description column will automatically expand to fill all unused
        space.  Therefore you should increase the size of all your other columns
        first and then decrease the size of the description column.
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="basics-toolbar2"></a>2.3.5. Tool Bar Buttons</h3></div></div><p>Both the account tree window and the account register window
      contain tool bar buttons. These buttons provide quick access to common
      functions such as Save and
      Open in the account tree window and
      Record and Delete in the
      account register window. If you are not sure what a button does, move
      the mouse pointer over that button, and you should see a description of
      the function appear.</p><p>Here is a summary of the account tree window buttons:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p>Save - Use this function often to save
          the current file to disk.</p></li><li><p>Close - Use this function to close the
          current notebook page.</p></li><li><p>Open, Edit,
          New and Delete - These
          are functions related to accounts. They are discussed in 
          <a href="chapter_accts.html" title="Chapter 3. Accounts">Chapter 3</a>.</p></li></ul></div><p>Register buttons are discussed in <a href="chapter_txns.html" title="Chapter 4. Transactions">Chapter 4</a>.
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="basics-options2"></a>2.3.6. Menu Items</h3></div></div><p>The account tree window and the account register window both
      contain menu headings in a menu bar. Clicking on a menu heading brings
      up the menu items for that heading.</p><p>You can click on the account tree menu headings and then move the
      mouse pointer over the menu items to see what they do. As the pointer
      moves over a menu item, a description of the item appears in the lower
      left-hand corner of the window. To select a menu item, click on
      it.</p><p>You can also access the most common menu items in a window by
      right-clicking the mouse anywhere in that window. In the account tree
      window, this will bring up a list of account items. In the account
      register window, this will bring up a list of transaction items.</p><p>Other ways of accessing menu items are through keyboard shortcuts
      and access keys, described next.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="basics-shortcut2"></a>2.3.7. Menu Shortcuts</h3></div></div><p>All of the menu items have access keys which are
      marked by underlined characters in the menu names. Pressing the
      <b>Alt</b> key with the underlined character in the menu
      heading will bring up the menu items for that heading. Once the menu
      items are displayed, type the underlined character in the menu item to
      activate it. For example, typing Alt+F in the main window brings up the <b>File</b>
      menu, then typing <b>S</b> will save the file.  Access keys
       are fixed and may not be changed by users.</p><p>Some of the more commonly used menu items also have shortcut keys
      that directly activate the command without having to traverse the menu
      structure.  These shortcuts typically use the <b>Ctrl</b>
      key, although they can use any key combination.  Menu shortcuts are
      displayed at the end of each menu item.  These shortcuts may be edited
      by users by setting a preference in the "Menu and Toolbar" preference
      panel.</p><p>GnuCash, as a Gnome application, also allows you to define your
      own menu shortcuts. To define a shortcut, first go to the "Menu and
      Toolbar" preference panel and select the "Editable menu accelerators"
      check box.  Then return to GnuCash, click on the menu header and move
      the mouse pointer over the menu item. While the menu item is
      highlighted, press a key or key combination to set the shortcut. You
      should now see your shortcut choice next to the item in the menu. To
      delete a shortcut, press the <b>Delete</b> key while the menu
      item is highlighted.  Be careful when setting shortcuts as Gnome does
      no checking on the key values pressed, and you can easily do things
      like set a letter of the alphabet as your shortcut.</p></div></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" class="navfooter"><hr></hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="basics-entry1.html">&lt;&lt;&lt; Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="basics-prefs1.html">Next &gt;&gt;&gt;</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left">2.2.
