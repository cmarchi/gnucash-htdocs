Accounting Concepts</h2></div></div><p>GnuCash is easy enough to use that you do not have to have a
    complete understanding of accounting principles to find it useful.
    However, you will find that some basic accounting knowledge will prove to
    be invaluable as GnuCash was designed using these principles as a
    template. It is highly recommended that you understand this section of the
    guide before proceeding.</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="basics-accounting52"></a>2.1.1. The 5 Basic Accounts</h3></div></div><p>Basic accounting rules group all finance related things into 5
      fundamental types of “accounts”. That is, everything that
      accounting deals with can be placed into one of these 5 accounts:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p><b>Assets</b> - things you own.</p></li><li><p><b>Liabilities</b> - things you owe.</p></li><li><p><b>Equity</b> - overall net worth.</p></li><li><p><b>Income</b> - increases the value of your
          accounts.</p></li><li><p><b>Expenses</b> - decreases the value of your
          accounts.</p></li></ul></div><p>It is clear that it is possible to categorize your financial world
      into these 5 groups. For example, the cash in your bank account is an
      asset, your mortgage is a liability, your paycheck is income, and the
      cost of dinner last night is an expense.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="basics-accountingequation2"></a>2.1.2. The Accounting Equation</h3></div></div><p>With the 5 basic accounts defined, what is the relationship
      between them? How does one type of account affect the others? Firstly,
      equity is defined by assets and liability. That is, your net worth is
      calculated by subtracting your liabilities from your assets:</p><p><b>Assets - Liabilities = Equity</b></p><p>Furthermore, you can increase your equity through income, and
      decrease equity through expenses. This makes sense of course, when you
      receive a paycheck you become "richer" and when you pay for dinner you
      become "poorer". This is expressed mathematically in what is known as
      the Accounting Equation:</p><p><b>Assets - Liabilities = Equity + (Income -
      Expenses)</b></p><p>This equation must always be balanced, a condition that can only
      be satisfied if you enter values to multiple accounts. For example: if
      you receive money in the form of income you must see an equal increase
      in your assets. As another example, you could have an increase in assets
      if you have a parallel increase in liabilities.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="figures/basics_AccountRelationships.png" alt="The basic accounts relationships"><div class="caption"><p>A graphical view of the relationship between the 5 basic

            value.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="basics-accountingdouble2"></a>2.1.3. Double Entry</h3></div></div><p>The accounting equation is the very heart of a double entry
      accounting system. For every change in value of one account in the
      Accounting Equation, there must be a balancing change in another. This
      concept is known as the <b>Principle of Balance</b>, and
      is of fundamental importance for understanding GnuCash and other double
      entry accounting systems. When you work with GnuCash, you will always be
      concerned with at least 2 accounts, to keep the Accounting Equation
      balanced.</p><p>Double entry accounting serves two purposes. The first is to
      create an accounting trail, money always has to come from somewhere and
      go to somewhere. Additionally, double entry accounting historically
      served to double check the math of an accountant. Because the numbers
      are entered into multiple accounts simultaneously, there are multiple
      places to check to make sure the totals match. Of course, with the
      advent of computers, the chances of a mathematical problem are low, but
      it is good to know that the concept still exists!</p><p>Double entry accounting has been around since the late 15th
      century, when it was described by an Italian friar, Luca Pacioli.
      Traditional double entry accounting involves recording each transaction
      in a book called a ledger, then copying each part of the transaction to
      separate books called journals. This method is still used in businesses
      today as a way to avoid entry errors and to track the source of those
      errors. GnuCash simplifies this traditional accounting by copying part
      of each transaction for you, so it may not catch some of the entry
      errors that would show up in traditional accounting. But it will flag
      transactions that are not balanced, and it will let you know when an
      account name is missing.</p><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img src="./stylesheet/note.png"></img></td><th align="left" valign="top">Note</th></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><p xmlns="">Calling this double-entry bookkeeping is a bit misleading; it
        would be somewhat more accurate to call it multiple- entry

        Unfortunately, there's 700 years of history of use of the term, which
        sufficiently discourages changing it.</p></td></tr></table></div></div></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" class="navfooter"><hr></hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="chapter_basics.html">&lt;&lt;&lt; Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="basics-entry1.html">Next &gt;&gt;&gt;</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left">Chapter 2.
