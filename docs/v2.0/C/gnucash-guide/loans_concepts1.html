Basic Concepts</h2></div></div><p>A loan is defined as a financial transaction in which someone pays
    for the use of someone else's money. There are many familiar examples of
    loans: credits cards, auto loans, house mortgages, or a business
    loan.</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="loans_conceptsterms2"></a>7.1.1. Terminology</h3></div></div><p>Before discussing tracking loan in GnuCash specifically, it will
      be helpful to present a glossary of terminology. The terms presented
      below represent some of the basic concepts found concerning loans. It is
      a good idea to become familiar with these terms, or at least, refer back
      to this list if you encounter an unfamiliar word in the later
      sections.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p><b>Amortization</b> - the repayment plan which
          will insure that a loan is eventually paid off, typically utilizing
          equal valued monthly payments. These payments are usually split into
          principal and interest, where the amount of principal per payment
          increases (and interest decreases) as the amortization period
          elapses.</p></li><li><p><b>Borrower</b> - the person or company that
          receives the money from a loan.</p></li><li><p><b>Default</b> - when a borrower fails to repay
          a loan according to the terms agreed upon with the lender.</p></li><li><p><b>Deferment</b> - a temporary delay in the
          repayment of a loan.</p></li><li><p><b>Delinquency</b> - is the term that refers to
          late payments.</p></li><li><p><b>Disbursement</b> - amount of the loan paid to
          the borrower. Some loans have multiple disbursements, meaning the
          borrower does not receive the full amount of the loan at one
          time.</p></li><li><p><b>Interest</b> - the expense charged by the
          lender to the borrower for the use of the money loaned. This is
          typically expressed in terms of a yearly percentage charged on the
          principal borrowed, known as the <b>Annual Percentage
          Rate</b> or APR.</p></li><li><p><b>Lender</b> - the company or person who lends
          money to a borrower.</p></li><li><p><b>Loan Fee</b> - a processing fee removed from
          the principal at the time the borrower receives a loan.</p></li><li><p><b>Principal</b> - the original amount of the
          loan, or the amount of the original loan that is still owed. When
          you make a monthly payment on a loan, part of the money pays the
          interest, and part pays the principal.</p></li><li><p><b>Promissory Note</b> - the legal agreement
          between the borrower and lender concerning the loan.</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" class="navfooter"><hr></hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="chapter_loans.html">&lt;&lt;&lt; Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="loans_accounts1.html">Next &gt;&gt;&gt;</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left">Chapter 7.
