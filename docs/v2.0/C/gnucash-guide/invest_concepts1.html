Basic Concepts</h2></div></div><p>An investment is something that you purchase in the hopes of
    generating income, or that you hope to sell in the future for more than
    you paid. Using this simple definition, many things could be considered
    investments: the house you live in, a valuable painting, stocks in
    publicly traded companies, your savings account at the bank, or a
    certificate of deposit. These many types of investments will be discussed
    in this chapter in terms of how to track them using GnuCash.</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="invest_terms2"></a>8.1.1. Terminology</h3></div></div><p>Before discussing investments specifically, it will be helpful to
      present a glossary of investment terminology. The terms presented below
      represent some of the basic concepts of investing. It is a good idea to
      become familiar with these terms, or at least, refer back to this list
      if you encounter an unfamiliar word in the later sections.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p><b>Capital gains</b> is the difference between
          the purchase and selling prices of an investment. If the selling
          price is lower than the purchase price, this is called a
          <b>capital loss</b>. Also known as <b>realized
          gain/loss</b>.</p></li><li><p><b>Commission</b> is the fee you pay to a broker
          to buy or sell securities.</p></li><li><p><b>Common stock</b> is a security that
          represents a certain fractional ownership of a company. This is what
          you buy when you "buy stock" in a company on the open market. This
          is also sometimes known as <b>capital
          stock</b>.</p></li><li><p><b>Compounding</b> is the concept that the
          reinvested interest can later earn interest of its own (interest on
          interest). This is often referred to as <b>compound
          interest</b>.</p></li><li><p><b>Dividends</b> are cash payments a company
          makes to shareholders. The amount of this payment is usually
          determined as some amount of the profits of the company. Note that
          not all common stocks give dividends.</p></li><li><p><b>Equities</b> are investments in which the
          investor becomes part (or whole) owner in something. This includes
          common stock in a company, or real estate.</p></li><li><p><b>Interest</b> is what a borrower pays a lender
          for the use of their money. Normally, this is expressed in terms of
          a percentage of the principal per year. For example, a savings
          account with 1% interest (you are the lender, the bank is the
          borrower) will pay you $1 for every $100 you keep there per
          year.</p></li><li><p><b>Liquidity</b> is a measure of how easily
          convertible an investment is to cash. Money in a savings account is
          very liquid, while money invested in a house has low liquidity
          because it takes time to sell a house.</p></li><li><p><b>Principal</b> is the original amount of money
          invested or borrowed.</p></li><li><p><b>Realized vs Unrealized Gain/Loss</b>,
          unrealized gain or loss occurs when you've got a change in price of
          an asset. You realize the gain/loss when you actually sell the
          asset. See also <b>capital gain/loss</b>.</p></li><li><p><b>Return</b> is the total income plus capital
          gains or losses of an investment. See also
          <b>Yield</b>.</p></li><li><p><b>Risk</b> is the probability that the return
          on investment is different from what was expected. Investments are
          often grouped on a scale from low risk (savings account, government
          bonds) to high risk (common stock, junk bonds). As a general rule of
          thumb, the higher the risk the higher the possible return.</p></li><li><p><b>Shareholder</b> is a person who holds common
          stock in a company.</p></li><li><p><b>Stock split</b> occurs when a company offers
          to issue some additional multiple of shares for each existing stock.
          For example, a "2 for 1" stock split means that if you own 100
          shares of a stock, you will receive an additional 100 at no cost to
          you. The unit price of the shares will be adjusted so there is no
          net change in the value, so in this example the price per share will
          be halved.</p></li><li><p><b>Valuation</b> is the process of determining
          the market value or the price the investment would sell at in a
          “reasonable time frame”.</p></li><li><p><b>Yield</b> is a measure of the amount of money
          you earn from an investment (IE: how much income you receive from
          the investment). Typically this is reported as a percentage of the
          principal amount. Yield does not include capital gains or loses (see
          Return). Eg: A stock sells for $100 and gives $2 in dividends per
          year has a yield of 2%.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="invest_types2"></a>8.1.2. Types of Investments</h3></div></div><p>Below is presented some of the broad types of investments
      available, and examples of each type.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p><b>Interest-bearing account or
          instrument</b></p><p>This type of investment usually allows you immediate access to
          your money, and will typically pay you interest every month based on
          the amount of money you have deposited. Examples are bank savings
          accounts (and some interest bearing checking accounts) and cash
          accounts at your brokerage. This is a very low risk investment, in
          the US these accounts are often insured against loss, to a specified
          limit.</p><p>Sometimes an interest bearing investment is
          <b>time-locked</b>. This type of investment requires
          you to commit your money to be invested for a given period of time
          for which you receive a set rate of return. Usually, the longer you
          commit the higher the interest rates. If you withdraw your money
          before the maturity date, you will usually have to pay an early
          withdrawal penalty. This is a relatively lower risk investment.
          Examples are certificates of deposit or some government bonds. Other
          types of Bonds may have higher yields based on the higher risks from
          the quality of the issuer's “credit rating”.</p></li><li><p><b>Stocks and Mutual Funds</b></p><p>This is an investment you make in a company, in which you
          effectively become a part owner. There is usually no time lock on
          publicly traded stock, however there may be changes in the tax rates
          you pay on capital gains depending on how long you hold the stock.
          Thus, stocks are typically quite liquid, you can access your money
          relatively quickly. This investment is a higher risk, as you have no
          guarantee on the future price of a stock.</p><p>A mutual fund is a group investment mechanism in which you can
          buy into many stocks simultaneously. For example, a "S&amp;P 500
          index fund" is a fund which purchases all 500 stocks listed in the
          Standard and Poor's index. When you buy a share of this fund, you
          are really buying a small amount of each of the 500 stocks contained
          within the fund. Mutual funds are treated exactly like a single
          stock, both for tax purposes and in accounting.</p></li><li><p><b>Fixed Assets</b></p><p>Assets that increase in value over time are another form of
          investment. Examples include a house, a plot of land, or a valuable
          painting. This type of investment is very difficult to determine the
          value of until you sell it. The tax implications of selling these
          items is varied, depending on the item. For example, you may have
          tax relief from selling a house if it is your primary residence, but
          may would not receive this tax break on an expensive
          painting.</p><p>Fixed asset investments are discussed in the chapter on
          "Depreciation and Capital Gains". Typically, there is not much to do
          in terms of accounting for fixed asset investments except recording
          the buying and selling transactions.</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" class="navfooter"><hr></hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="chapter8.html">&lt;&lt;&lt; Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="invest_accounts1.html">Next &gt;&gt;&gt;</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left">Chapter 8.
