Entering Deposits</h2></div></div><p>Most deposit transactions are entered as a transfer from an income
    account to a bank account. Income may come from many sources, and it's a
    good idea to set up a separate income type account for each different
    source. For example, your income may come mainly from your paychecks, but
    you may also receive interest on your savings. In this case, you should
    have one income account for salary and another income account for interest
    income.</p><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img src="./stylesheet/tip.png"></img></td><th align="left" valign="top">Tip</th></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><p xmlns="">Be sure to check the Tax-Related box in the Account Information
      Dialog when you set up taxable income accounts. Some types of income,
      such as gift income, may not be considered taxable, so check the
      appropriate tax rules to determine what is taxable. For ways to track
      capital gains income, refer to <a href="chapter_capgain.html" title="Chapter 9. Capital Gains">Chapter 9</a>.</p></td></tr></table></div><p>Before you start entering paycheck deposits, decide how much detail
    you want to track. The basic level of detail is to enter your net pay,
    just like you would in your paper register. This is easiest, but you can
    get even more information out of GnuCash if you enter your gross pay with
    deductions. It takes a bit more effort to enter the deductions, but
    entering your tax withholding information throughout the year allows you
    to run useful tax status reports in GnuCash at any time. These reports can
    help you determine whether you are withholding enough tax, and they can
    help you estimate your tax bill ahead of time. If you are unsure about the
    level of detail, start by entering net pay. You can always go back and
    edit your transactions later if you decide you want more detail.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" class="navfooter"><hr></hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="cbook-accounts1.html">&lt;&lt;&lt; Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="cbook-withdrawals1.html">Next &gt;&gt;&gt;</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left">5.1.
