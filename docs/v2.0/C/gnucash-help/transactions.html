Transactions are entered into the Account Register Window. This section describes the tools GnuCash has to help enter transactions quickly into the register. </p><p></p><p>A  represents the movement of money from one account to another account. Whenever you spend or receive money, or transfer money between accounts, that is a transaction. In GnuCash transactions always involve at least two accounts.</p><p></p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="reg-views"></a>5.3.1. Changing the Register View</h3></div></div><p>GnuCash has several options to change the way the register looks so transactions can be seen more clearly. The default style is the Basic Ledger. This presents a single line view of transactions to allow the most concise view with all the relevant details.</p><p>The default view or style can be changed by going to View -&gt; Style. When the window closes the style will revert to the Basic Ledger style. To make this change permanent change the style in the Preferences in the Register section.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p>Basic Ledger: The default one line per transaction style. Splits are shown as a summary.</p></li><li><p>Auto-Split Ledger: This style will automatically expand the splits in any transaction selected.</p></li><li><p>Transaction Journal: This style expands all transactions so the complete transaction can be seen.</p></li><li><p>Double Line: This check-box changes any of the above styles so that an additional line for notes about the transaction is added.</p></li></ul></div><p>The two other options to change the view of the register is to restrict the Date Range and change the Sort Order. These are both accessible from the View menu.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="trans-enter"></a>5.3.2. To Enter a Transaction</h3></div></div><p>When the Account Register Window for an account is opened the list of transactions for that account is shown. This window has the name of the account on its title bar. The menus contain several functions that alter the display of transactions. The toolbar also contains several functions that are used often when entering transactions. These are described in the Account Register Window section of this help.</p><p>GnuCash has two methods available for entering transactions. Entering directly into the register window is the most common way of entering transactions. The Transfer Funds Window is the second method.</p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="trans-reg-enter"></a>5.3.2.1. Enter Directly in the Register Window</h4></div></div><p>The register window will look slightly different depending on the style options you have chosen. The following describes entering transactions in the basic ledger style. The cursor is placed in the date field by default when the register window is opened.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Selecting the triangle icon on the right of the date field drops down a date selection dialog. Use the arrows to select the correct month and year for the transaction then select the date. Selecting the triangle icon once more will close the date selection dialog. It is also possible to type in the date or part of the date and let GnuCash fill the rest.</p></li><li><p>Press tab to move or select the Num field. Here you can enter a check or transaction number. Pressing '+' (plus) will automatically advance the number by one from the last transaction to have a number.</p></li><li><p>Press tab to move or select the Description field. This field is used to enter either a payee or other description for the transaction. It will automatically attempt to fill the payee name as you type.</p></li><li><p>At this stage two things will happen if tab is pressed. If GnuCash matches an existing transaction the cursor will jump to one of the amount fields, automatically filling in the transfer account. If there is no existing transaction GnuCash will move the cursor to the Transfer field. Selecting the Transfer field with the mouse instead of tabbing will not automatically fill the Transfer field.</p></li><li><p>When typing in the Transfer field GnuCash will also attempt to automatically match the account. It does this alphabetically, so typing 'Ex' will match the Expenses section of the account list. When the section is matched, it is possible to move to a child account by pressing ':' (colon). If after typing 'Ex' you press ':' then the cursor will move to the first child account in the list. Typing combinations of letters and ':' will allow movement down the tree of accounts quickly. The triangle icon on the right of the Transfer box can be used as an alternate way of selecting accounts.</p></li><li><p>The next field is used for reconciliation. This is described in the To Reconcile an Account to a Statement section above.</p></li><li><p>Press tab to move to the first of the amount fields. The name of the next two columns is different according to what type of account is opened. For example, Bank accounts show Deposit and Withdrawal here, Credit Card accounts show Payment and Charge, and Stock accounts show Shares, Price, Buy and Sell.</p></li><li><p>Enter an amount for the transaction in the correct field. Pressing the Enter key, selecting the Enter icon or going to Actions -&gt; Enter will finish the transaction.

         ability to print to standard Quicken Checks (US Letter) or to make a custom check
         format. Check position and Date formats are also customizable.</p><p>To access the check printing feature in GnuCash, select the transaction to print
         a check for and go to File -&gt; Print Check. This will open the Print Check
         properties dialog.</p><p>The Print Check dialog has two tabs. The first tab, Options, is used to setup
         the most common options to print a check. The second tab, Custom format, is used to
         setup the position of various fields on the check. It is useful to print a test check
         to a plain piece of paper first and use that to make any adjustments needed.</p><p>The default selection in Options is for Quicken/Quickbooks (tm) US-Letter
         checks.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p>Check format: Test with Quicken first then use custom if the position is
             incorrect.</p></li><li><p>Check position: This sets if the Top, Middle or Bottom check is printed.
             Custom is used if the position of the checks on the page is incorrect.</p></li><li><p>Date format: The default here is set in the Preferences International
             section. Choose a date format. This can also be adjusted by the Use of the Months:
             and Years: lines. Custom allows the date format to be set in the Format: box (%m
             means month, %d means day, %Y means year) A Sample of the format chosen is
             displayed below.</p></li></ul></div><p>The Custom check format contains two columns to enter in the X and Y
         co-ordinates of the field position on the check. Positions in the Custom Check Format
         entry area are specified with x = 0 at the left edge of the check with x increasing
         to the right, and y = 0 at the bottom edge of the check with y increasing as you
         travel up.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p>Payee: </p></li><li><p>Date: </p></li><li><p>Amount (words): </p></li><li><p>Amount (numbers): </p></li><li><p>Memo: </p></li><li><p>Check position: </p></li><li><p>Date format: </p></li><li><p>Units: Set the unit to use for the above positions.</p></li></ul></div><p>Once OK is pressed on the Print Check dialog the Print GnuCash Document dialog
