       data in various ways. This can range from a simple summary of account totals to an
       advanced portfolio view. This section will present an explanation of the main GnuCash
       reports and how to adjust them.</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="report-types"></a>5.4.1. Types of Reports and Graphs</h3></div></div><p>GnuCash has classified the main types of reports into four major classes. These
         are all available under the Reports menu. Note that barcharts can be moved by clicking
         on them and dragging the mouse, and piecharts can be "exploded" into individual
         segments.</p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="report-general"></a>5.4.1.1. General Reports</h4></div></div><p>The General Reports includes the Tax Report and TXF Export, the Account

               into tax filing programs such as TaxCut or TurboTax.</p><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img src="./stylesheet/note.png"></img></td><th align="left" valign="top">Note</th></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><p xmlns="">For this to work, the user has to segregate taxable and non taxable

           go to Edit -&gt; Tax Options. The user also must set the TXF category of each tax

To Create Reports and Graphs</h3></div></div><p>It is possible to write reports if the current ones are not suitable. To do this
         you will need to know Scheme (a LISP-like programming language), and it is an
         excellent idea to have a copy of the GnuCash source code available. </p><p>The reporting interface is documented in the source code file
         src/report/report-system/doc/report-html.txt. The file src/scm/report/hello-world.scm
         in the GnuCash source distribution provides a good example of how reports are
         developed.</p><p>It is also necessary to access data from the engine to get information for your
         report. This is performed by a set of Scheme wrapper functions that are documented in
         the file src/g-wrap/gnc.html. Examine some of the other reports in src/scm/report for
         an indication of how they are used.</p><p>At present, reports are produced by calling a HTML-generation API, which outputs
         a dialect of HTML and rendering this with a HTML widget. This has limitations,
         particularly when trying to align objects precisely, as might be necessary for
         printing onto pre-printed invoices for example.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="report-custom"></a>5.4.3. To Customize Reports and Graphs</h3></div></div><p>GnuCash reports have many options for customization. To access report options
         choose the Options button on the toolbar.</p><p>Many reports share similar sorts of options. Some common ones include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p>Report Name: Set the title of the report. This is also used to print the
             report for later viewing.</p></li><li><p>Date Options: Reports typically specify either a single date, or a date
             range, for the report. Dates can be specified in two ways, either directly
             (using the date selector), or by selecting a relative date from the menu.
             Relative dates allow you to specify dates like "Beginning of this year" or
             "Today".</p></li><li><p>Step Size: This option is used on bar charts to determine the interval which
             each bar represents. Typical values are daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly.</p></li><li><p>Accounts: Select the appropriate accounts for the report. Note that in some
             reports only certain types of accounts can be selected. For example, an expense
             piechart only allows expense accounts to be selected. </p></li><li><p>Show Long Account Names: This option allows displaying either short account
             names (for example, Power) or long account names (for example, Utilities:Power).
            </p></li><li><p>Include Subaccounts?: Summary reports typically have an include all
             subaccounts option, which if selected ensures that all subaccounts are included
             if the parent account is.</p></li><li><p>Depth: This option allows the selection of how many levels the report
             displays subaccounts. If the subaccounts go deeper than selected, an overall value
             for all the subaccounts is calculated and included in a total. To make sure every
             account selected is individually displayed, select All.</p></li><li><p>Style Sheet: Select a Style Sheet. Style sheets control how reports are
             displayed. At the moment, there are two style sheets, "default" and "technicolor".
             You can customize each of these from the Edit -&gt; Style Sheets... menu item.
             This is described in the Changing Style Sheets section.</p></li><li><p>Plot Dimensions: There are width and height options for most graphs, which
             specify the displayed dimensions (in pixels).</p></li><li><p>Report Currency: Select the report currency. Generally, values will be
             converted to this currency for display.</p></li><li><p>Price Source: Select how stock and currency prices are calculated in this
             report. Choose between a weighted average of prices over all transactions, prices
             at current values, or prices at the time of the report date.</p></li><li><p>Totals: Charts display totals in the chart legend if this option is selected.
            </p></li><li><p>Maximum Slices: Controls the maximum number of slices displayed in a
             piechart - other accounts will be placed in a slice marked Other. </p></li><li><p>Maximum Bars: Controls the maximum number of bars displayed in a barchart.
            </p></li><li><p>Display Columns: Choose columns to show from the register.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="report-print"></a>5.4.4. To Print or Export Reports and Graphs</h3></div></div><p>GnuCash is able to print reports and to export the reports to web pages. The
         Print GnuCash Document dialog is accessed from the Print button on the toolbar or
         go to File -&gt; Print in the menu. To Export a report to a web page (HTML) select
         the Export button on the toolbar and type in a file name.</p><p>The Print GnuCash Document dialog is used to select which Printer to send the
         print job to or to print to a File. It also contains a Preview button to view the
         document before printing. Press Print to send the job to the selected printer or
         Cancel to dismiss the Print dialog.</p><p>Printing from an open register prints the Account Report, which is also called
         the Register Report. This lists transactions in the account with a total. Other
         reports print as viewed in the Report screen.</p></div></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" class="navfooter"><hr></hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="transactions.html">&lt;&lt;&lt; Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="help.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="custom-gnucash.html">Next &gt;&gt;&gt;</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left">5.3.
