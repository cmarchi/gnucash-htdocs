Accounting Features</h3></div></div><p>For those knowledgeable in accounting, here is a list of GnuCash's accounting features.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p><b>Double Entry</b>: When enabled, every transaction must debit one account and credit others by an equal amount.  This ensures the "books balance" - that the difference between income and expense exactly equals the sum of all bank, cash, stock and other assets.</p></li><li><p><b>Split Transactions</b>: A single transaction can be split into several pieces to record taxes, fees, and other compound entries.</p></li><li><p><b>Chart of Accounts</b>: A master account can have a hierarchy of detail accounts underneath it.  This allows similar account types such as Cash, Bank, or Stock to be grouped into a master account such as &#8220;Assets&#8221;.</p></li><li><p><b>General Ledger</b>: One register window can display multiple accounts at the same time.  This eases the trouble of tracking down typing/entry errors.  It also provides a convenient way of viewing a portfolio of many stocks, by showing all transactions in that portfolio.</p></li><li><p><b>Income/Expense Account Types (Categories)</b>:  
    These categorize your cash flow and, when used properly with the double-entry feature, will provide an accurate Profit&amp;Loss statement.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="oview_featuresnew2"></a>1.2.6.
