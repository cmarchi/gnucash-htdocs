The Account Register</h2></div></div><p>
The <b>account register</b> is the GnuCash window which allows you to view or edit preexisting transactions, or add new transactions for a particular account.  To enter the account register, simply highlight the account name in the account tree window and double-click to open it.  You can also click the Open button in the tool bar or use the right mouse button menu to open the account.  GnuCash will display the account register window.

For example, starting with the chart of accounts we created in the previous chapter, double click on the <b>checking</b> asset account.  Let's add a simple transaction to the checking account.  When you first create your accounts in GnuCash, it is common to start them off with an initial balance.  
   </p><p>
In the first transaction row, enter a date (eg: June 1, 2003), a description (eg: &quot;Opening Balance&quot;), click on the Transfer pop-up menu and select <b>Equity:Starting Balances</b>, add a deposit value of $1000, and press the Enter key.  The account register should now appear similar to this figure:
   </p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="figures/txns_register_2account.png" alt="The Checking Account - Register"><div class="caption"><p>This image shows <b>Asset:Checking -
	       Register</b> after inserting a starting value transaction.
	       </p></div></div></div><p>
Setting the starting balances of an account is an example of a simple two account transaction.  In this case, affecting the <b>Asset:Checking</b> and the <b>Equity:Starting Balances</b> accounts.
   </p><p>
As another example of a simple 2 account transaction, add another transaction to describe the purchase of $45.21 worth of groceries.  From within the Asset:Checking account, you would set <b>Transfer</b> to <b>Expenses:Groceries</b>.  The account register should now appear:
   </p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="figures/txns_register_2account2.png" alt="The Checking Account - Register"><div class="caption"><p>This image shows <b>Asset:Checking -
	       Register</b> after adding a transaction for groceries.
	       </p></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="txns_registers_multiaccount2"></a>4.2.2. Split Transaction</h3></div></div><p>
The need for 3 or more account transactions occurs when you need to split either the &quot;from&quot; or the &quot;to&quot; account in a transaction into multiple accounts.  The classic example of this is when you receive a paycheck.  Your take home pay from a paycheck will typically be less than your net pay, with the difference being due to taxes, retirement account payments, and/or other items.  Thus, the single transaction of you receiving a paycheck involves other accounts besides simply  <b>Assets:Checking</b> and <b>Income:Salary</b>.
  </p><p>
To add a paycheck transaction from the <b>Assets:Checking</b> account register window, click on a new transaction line, and click on <b>Split</b>.  First enter the description of this transaction on the first line (eg: &quot;Employers R Us&quot;).  In the &quot;split&quot; line below this, the the gross total of your paycheck (eg: $1000) as a withdrawal transfer from <b>Income:Salary</b>.  Now, individually insert deposits to <b>Asset:Checking</b> (eg: $670), <b>Expenses:Taxes:Federal</b> (eg: $180), <b>Expenses:Taxes:Medicare</b> (eg: $90), and <b>Expenses:Taxes:Social Security</b> (eg: $60).  The final split should look like this:
  </p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="figures/txns_register_multiaccount.png" alt="Account Register - Split Transaction"><div class="caption"><p>This image shows <b>Asset:Checking -
	       Register</b> after adding a split transaction for salary.
	       </p></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="txns_registers_features2"></a>4.2.3. Features of the Account Register</h3></div></div><p>
The title bar of the account register displays the account name, which in this case is <b>Asset:Checking</b>.   Below the title bar, the menu bar displays the menu items available within the account register, and the tool bar contains handy buttons that help you work with the account register.
    </p><p>
Although each transaction has at least two splits, all you see in the basic register is a summary of the splits affecting the current account.  In the Transfer column, you can see the other account from which money is <b>transferred</b> into or out of this account.   If the transaction affects more than two accounts, GnuCash displays <b>-- Split Transaction --</b> to show it is a multiple-split transaction.  You can see the individual splits of each transaction by clicking the <b>Split</b> button in the tool bar while selecting the appropriate transaction.
    </p><p>
For split transactions, the first line of the transaction is the <b>transaction line</b>.   It contains a <b>Date</b>, optional <b>Num</b> (such as a check number), transaction <b>Description</b>, total amount affecting the current account (<b>Tot Deposit</b> here), and updated account <b>Balance</b> after the current transaction.  Note that in the expanded view, the <b>Transfer</b> column heading disappears, and there is no account name listed in that field.  This line shows you only a summary of the transaction's effect on the current account.  For more detailed information, you need to look at the individual splits that make up the transaction.
    </p><p>
The partial lines below the transaction line are the <b>split lines</b>, and they are separated by gray lines.   As you highlight one of the split lines, the column headings change to show the split-related  fields:

<div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="figures/txns_registersplit2.png" alt="How split headings change"><div class="caption"><p>This image shows how split headings change.
	       </p></div></div></div>

    </p><p>
Each split contains an optional <b>Action</b>, or type of split, which you can either type in or choose from a pull-down list. The split also contains an optional <b>Memo</b> which describes the split.  Each split affects an <b>Account</b>, which can be selected from a pull-down list of your accounts.  The <b>R</b> field indicates whether the split has been reconciled.  The last two columns show the amount of the split and whether money is coming into or going out of the account.
    </p><p>
As we discussed in section 2.1, total debits (left-column entries) must equal total credits (right-column entries) for each transaction.  In the example shown above, the total debits equal the total credits, so this transaction is balanced.   If you notice, the transaction line contains the same debit amount as the <b>Checking</b> split line.  Why is this shown twice?  Because the transaction line is merely a <b>summary</b> of the transaction's effect on the current account.   The same transaction in a different account will have a different transaction line, one that shows the effect on that particular account.  You can see this by highlighting another split line and clicking the <b>Jump</b> button on the tool bar.
    </p><p>
In this example, if you jump to the <b>Income:Salary</b> account, GnuCash brings up the same transaction in the <b>Income:Salary - Register</b>:

<div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="figures/txns_registersplit3.png" alt="A jump to the Income:Salary account"><div class="caption"><p>This image shows a jump to the <b>Income:Salary
	       </b> account.
	       </p></div></div></div>

    </p><p>
Note that the transaction line total now summarizes the effect on the <b>Income:Salary</b> account instead of the <b>Checking Account</b>, because you are looking at the <b>Income:Salary</b> account register.    The splits are exactly the same, but the transaction line now reflects the credit to the <b>Income:Salary</b> account.
    </p><p>
At the bottom left of the register window, GnuCash displays helpful messages as you move about the register.   To the right, you can see the current account balance and the total of cleared splits.
