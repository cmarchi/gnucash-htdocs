Setup Stock Portfolio</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you have build an account hierarchy in the previous section, this section will show you how to populate the accounts with your stock portfolio.  During this initial setup of your portfolio, you may have stocks purchased from before you started using GnuCash.  For these stocks, follow the instructions in the <b>Setup Your Pre-existing Stocks</b> section below.  If your have just purchased your stocks, then use the <b>Buying New Stocks</b> section.
 </p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="invest_setup_preexisting2"></a>8.4.1. Setup Preexisting Stocks</h3></div></div><p>
This section will show you how to add stocks to GnuCash assuming that you purchased these stocks from before you started using GnuCash.  In this section, we will assume you are using the basic predefined account setup introduced in the previous section, but the principles can be applied to any account hierarchy.
 </p><p>
You should have within the top level <b>Asset</b> account, a few levels down, an account entitled <b>Stock</b>.  Open the account tree to this level by clicking on the + (plus) signs next to the account names until the tree to fully opened.  You will need to create a sub-account (of type <b>stock</b>) under the Stock account for every stock you own.  Every stock is a separate account.  The naming of these stock accounts is usually done using the stock ticker abbreviation.  So, for example, you could name your accounts <b>AMZN</b> and <b>IBM</b> for your Amazon and IBM stocks respectively.  Below is a schematic model of the layout (only showing the Assets sub-accounts).

Example Stock Account</h3></div></div><p>As an example, let's assume that you currently own 100 shares of Amazon stock.  First, create the stock account AMZN by selecting the <b>Stock</b> account and click on the menu <b>File</b> -&gt; <b>New Account</b>.  The New Account dialog will appear, follow the step below to setup your new stock account.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><b>Name the Account</b> - Usually, use the stock ticker abbreviation, IE: &#8220;AMZN&#8221;</p></li><li><p><b>Create the New Commodity</b> - To use a new stock, you must create the stock as a new commodity</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="a"><li><p><b>Select Commodity</b> - Click on the &#8220;Select&#8221; button next to the <b>Commodity</b> line.  We must change the commodity from the default (your default currency) to this specific stock.  This will bring up the &#8220;Select currency/security&#8221; dialog.</p></li><li><p><b>Commodity Type</b> - Change the <b>type</b> from CURRENCY to (in this example) NASDAQ. </p></li><li><p><b>Create the Commodity</b> - Click on the <b>New...</b> button and enter the appropriate information for this stock.  The <b>Full name:</b> is &#8220;Amazon.com Inc&#8221;, the <b>Symbol/abbreviation:</b> is &#8220;AMZN&#8221;, the <b>Type:</b> should already be &#8220;NASDAQ&#8221;, the <b>CUSIP or other code</b> is where you can enter some other coding number or text (leave it blank in this example), and finally the <b>Fraction traded</b> should be adjusted to the smallest fraction of this commodity which can be traded, usually 1/100 or 1/10000.  Below is what this window should look like when finished:
  	<div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="figures/invest_newsecurity.png" alt="New Security Window"><div class="caption"><p>New Security Window
	       </p></div></div></div>
  </p></li><li><p><b>Save Commodity</b> - Click on the <b>OK</b> button to save this new commodity</p></li></ol></div></li><li><p><b>Select the Commodity</b> - you should now see the newly create commodity available in the pull down menu for <b>Currency/security</b>.  Select it (it is probably already selected) and click on <b>OK</b>.</p></li><li><p><b>Finished</b> - You should now have been automatically returned to the New Account dialog, with the <b>Commodity:</b> line set to &#8220;AMZN (Amazon.com Inc)&#8221;.  Click on <b>OK</b> to save this new stock account.</p></li></ol></div><p>You have now create the Amazon stock account, your main account should look something like this (notice that there are a few extra account here, a bank account, and an equity account):</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="figures/invest_setup_current.png" alt="Setup Current Portfolio"><div class="caption"><p>This image the creation of the first stock account
	       </p></div></div></div><p>
Open the account register window for this AMZN stock account (double click on it).  Here you see the <b>Portfolio</b> view. This gives  you an overview of your stock portfolio including the number of shares bought and sold.  Obviously, we have not bought or sold any stocks yet, so the Portfolio view should not contain any transactions.
 </p><p>
To register the initial 100 shares of this stock that you purchased previously, on the first transaction line, enter the date of the purchase (eg: Jan. 1 2001), a description (eg: Initial Purchase), transfer from <b>Equity: Opening Balances</b>, Shares (eg: 100), and Price (eg: $20).  You do not need to fill in the <b>Buy</b> column, as it will be calculated for you.  Your AMZN Portfolio view should now appear like this:
 </p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="figures/invest_setup_portfolio1.png" alt="Setup Current Portfolio"><div class="caption"><p>This image the creation of the first stock account</p></div></div></div><p>
Notice that the <b>Balance</b> is in the units of the commodity (AMZN shares) not in currency units.  Thus, the balance is 100 (AMZN units) rather than $2000.  This is how it should be.
  </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="invest_setup_new2"></a>8.4.3. Buying New Investments</h3></div></div><p>
The only difference between setting up a new investment purchase versus the setup for preexisting stocks as described in the previous section is that instead of transferring the money used to purchase the stock from the Equity:Starting Balances account, you use your Asset:Bank account.
