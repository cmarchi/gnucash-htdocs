    Motif as a school project, taking it to version 0.9 by October
    1997.  Although every single
    line of his code has been re-written, his name appears as a
    credit in almost every file.  Such is the magic of copyrights.</P

>liked what he saw: the GUI was slick, the code was
      documented and well structured, and it was all GPL'ed. And so he
      re-wrote it: adding cell-widgets to XbaeMatrix, so that the
      combobox and arrows would make an even slicker GUI, rewrote the
      <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>X-Accountant</TT
> internals to add
      double-entry, an account hierarchy, split out a transaction
      mini-engine, add support for stocks, and spiffed up the help
      menus. That was version 1.0 as of January 1998. For
      version 1.1 &#38; 1.2, the engine was expanded and refined, and the
      register window code completely redesigned and made mostly
      Motif-(and GUI-)independent. 
    Linas is now active with Gnumatic Incorporated, a company formed to
    enhance and support GnuCash for everyone, from home desktop users
    to commercial and professional accountants.</P

      (Actually, put the selection
      of the name up to popular vote.  Democracy is not
      a good way to pick names.)
      Jeremy registered the domain name, and created and maintained
      the gnucash.org web site for years,
      and got the initial GTK/gnome code working.

      added Perl support, dumped Perl in favor of Guile/Scheme

      (As he is now the gatekeeper of the GnuCash CVS tree, be nice to him,
      or he may decide to stop hacking in the middle of your patch).
