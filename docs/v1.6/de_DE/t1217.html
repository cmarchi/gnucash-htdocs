>If you hold assets for business purposes, thier decline in value over
time can be treated as a deduction for tax purposes, called
Depreciation.  On the other hand, if you own assets such as real estate,
collectibles (like paintings), and investments (like shares in
companies), you may see them appreciate in value over time.  In this
case, you must recognize -- for tax purposes -- what are called

HREF="t1217.html"
>Depreciation</A
> 
        is <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"

        recognized (the technical term is <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>accrued</I
>) as an
        ongoing expense, gradually reducing the value
        of an asset toward zero. 
        Depreciation is usually only calculated on assets 
        used for professional or business purposes, because
        governments don't generally allow you to claim depreciation
        deductions on personal assets, and it's pointless to bother
        with the procedure if it's not deductible.

        (As always, there are exceptions. If you hold a bond

        often require that you recognize interest each year,
        and refuse this to be treated as a capital gain. The
        phrases <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"

>Appreciation of assets is generally a tricky
    matter because, for some sorts of
    assets, it is difficult to correctly estimate an increase in
    value <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>until you actually sell the asset.</I
>

    If you invest in securities
    traded daily on open markets such as stock
    exchanges, prices are often quite exact, and selling the asset at
    market prices may be as simple as calling a broker and issuing
    a <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Market Order.</I
>
    On the other hand, homes in your neighborhood are sold
    somewhat less often.  Such sales tend to involve expending
    considerable effort, and involve negotiations, which means that
    estimates are likely to be less precise. Similarly, selling a
    used automobile involves a negotiation process that makes
    pricing a bit less predictable.

    </P

>Values of collectible objects such as
    jewelry, works of art, baseball cards, and "Beanie Babies" 
    are harder to estimate.
    The
    markets for such objects are somewhat less open than the
    securities markets.
    Worse still are one-of-a-kind assets. Factories often
    contain presses and dies customized to build a very specific
    product that cost tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars;
    this equipment may be <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>worthless</I
> outside of that very
    specific context. In such cases, several conflicting
    values might be attached to the asset, <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>none</I

    unambiguously correct.

>Let's suppose you buy an asset expected to increase in
    value, say a Degas painting, and want to track this. (The

    Properly tracking the continually increasing value of the
    Degas will require at least three, quite possibly the following

    The people that got "rich" in 1999 from IPOs of
