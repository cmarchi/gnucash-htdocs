>Each line in the Accounts tab display represents a mapping from
a Quicken account to a GnuCash account.  Similarly, the Categories tab
display shows mappings from Quicken categories to GnuCash
accounts. Only QIF accounts referenced by one or more transaction
records are displayed.  The name of the GnuCash account is displayed
in "full name" format, including the names of all parent accounts
separated by your default separator character (generally ":").

    </P
><P
>The first thing to check is the column of Quicken account
names.  Make sure there are no duplicates with slightly-different
names.  If a QIF transaction makes a transfer to [My Checking], and
you imported a file called my-checking.qif, you might have one account
entry for "my checking" and one for "My Checking".  If these are the
same account, you need to go back to the Files tab and reload
my-checking.qif with the correct Quicken account name, My Checking.

    </P
><P
>Once you have all the Quicken accounts making sense, check the
GnuCash account column.  The default GnuCash account for a given
Quicken account is determined by a fallback procedure which makes the
best guess it can given the available information.  The guesses that
are tried are (in order of preference):

>Saved mappings from previous import sessions.  Each time you
click "OK" in the import dialog, the mappings that you have selected
are saved for the next time you import files.  At the moment, the file
is always called ~/.gnucash/qif-accounts-map.  If you get some weird
default mappings (for instance, if you change an account name and the
importer wants to keep creating a new account with the old name) just
delete this file.  It's on my wishlist to make this work a little
more smoothly.

      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Similar accounts from your existing GnuCash account tree. 
"Similar" means that the account types are compatible and the names 
could reasonably be assumed to refer to the same thing.  Full-path
exact name matches are preferred most, followed by case-insensitive 
matches, followed by matches with prepended account parents (i.e. 
QIF account Visa matches GnuCash account Credit Cards:Visa), followed
by various substring matches.  If you think of a good heuristic
for this, let me know. 

      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>New account.  The name of the new account is currently just
the same as the name of the Quicken account; again, if you think of a
good heuristic to make this better let me know.  I've thought about
making it look for subtrees to insert into (if all existing credit
card accounts are children of an account, make the new account a child
of that account, etc).  On the wishlist.

>Check both the name of the GnuCash account for each QIF account
and the type.  If you are unhappy with either, click on the row in the
display containing the offensive mapping.  You will see the
