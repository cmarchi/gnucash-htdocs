>	  GnuCash offers the facility to do simple interest calculations
	  for loans and interest-bearing deposits, giving you the ability
	  to answer questions like "How long will it take me to pay off
	  this loan?", "Which of these two term deposits generate better
	  returns?", and "What loan payments do I need to make to pay
	  off this loan in, say, five years?"  GnuCash's financial
	  calculator gives you that information, and more.

><P
>	  There's two angles for talking about interest - 
	  interest-bearing accounts such as savings accounts
	  and term deposits, when financial institutions pay
	  you for the use of your money.  Alternatively, 
	  we can discuss interest in the context of loans, where
	  you pay your financial institution for using their money.
	  To make things simple, we'll talk about loans first.
	</P
><P
>	  Firstly, let's consider the simplest possible loan
	  where with a simple interest rate and we pay it
	  back at the conclusion  of the term.  For example, 
	  let's say we borrow $10,000 (in financial terms, 
	  the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Present Value</I
> is $10,000)
	  for one year at an interest rate of 10% per annum
	  that doesn't compound.  How much do we owe at the end
	  of it?
          In this case, calculating the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Future Value</I
> 
	  that we owe is easy: it's just

	               = 10,000 + (10% * 10,000)
	               = 11,000

	  Let's make the interest <I

	  than the $11,000 you would have paid with simple interest.
	</P
><P
>	  Next, we'll make things more complex again - let's say
	  we'll make a <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>periodic payment</I
> of 
	  $200 at the end of every month?  Well, let's see.  After
	  one month, you'd owe:

          after month 1 = 10,000 + (10% * 1/12) - 200 
	                = 9,883.33
	</PRE

><P
>	  After one year, if you do the calculations, you'll still
	  owe $8534.02 (if I've done my maths right . . .)
	</P
><P
>	  For our final example, consider <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>continuous compounding</I
>,
	  where interest is charged continuously.  Explaining this calculation in
	  detail requires a little bit of university-level maths, but, roughly,
	  imagine that the payment periods are, really, really, really small!  
	  I can't easily show you the calculations for this, but that doesn't
	  matter.  GnuCash's financial calculator can do them!
