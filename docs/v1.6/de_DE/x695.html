>	At its core, GnuCash is a tool for tracking
	<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>transactions</I
>. A transaction is a record
	of money being removed from one "account" and placed in
	another.  To take a simple example, say you have two bank
	accounts - a cheque account (that's checking, for the
	Americans in the audience . . .), and an investment account,
	and you transfer $500 from the cheque account to the
	investment account. GnuCash records that transfer.

>	  "But what about when I buy things, or get paid?"  I hear you ask.
	  Well, "accounts" in GnuCash aren't just bank accounts.  You can
	  set up Income accounts, expense accounts, asset, liability, share
	  accounts, mutual fund accounts - in fact, there are a total of 
	  11 different account types GnuCash supports.  You can (and should)
	  set up a number of different expense accounts for different
	  types of expenditure.  So, your paycheck would be a transfer
	  from, say "salary", an income account, to your checking account.
	  Buying fuel with your credit card might be a transfer from 
	  "ABC Visa", a credit card account, to "Fuel", an expense account.
	  If you've grasped all that, you're 90% of the way to making best
	  use of GnuCash!
	</P

>	  Now, if you're going to keep proper track of your finances,
	  you'll obviously want to create a variety of expense and
	  income accounts for keeping track of various transactions
	  you'll make - in fact, setting up the right set of accounts
	  is the key to making GnuCash work for you.  However, if you
	  create many different accounts, it can be a pain to keep
	  track of them all.  GnuCash has a way of dealing with this,
	  though.  It lets you create a <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>tree</I
>of
	  accounts.  For instance, you can create a "Utilities"
	  expense account, and then create "Utilities:Power",
	  "Utilities:Gas", and "Utilities:Phone".  We term "Utilities"
	  to be the "parent" account, and the three others to be
	  "subaccounts".  When you produce <A
HREF="t4247.html"
> reports</A
> of your financial
	  data, you can choose whether to display a summary of all
	  "utilities" accounts, or data for each individual account.
