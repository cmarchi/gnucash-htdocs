>Quicken is one of the best-selling programs in the history of
the Universe.  Pretty much everyone that has owned a PC or Mac since
the late 80's has had a copy of it lying around somewhere, and lots of
people actually use it to keep track of their finances.  Why?  Because
it works pretty well and Intuit has (to their credit) done a good job
of keeping up with what people want the program to do.

    </P
><P
>They've done such a good job, in fact, that lots of Linux folks
keep a Windows partition on their machine just so they can run Quicken
and the latest shoot-em-up games.  So of course we want to give you a
way to suck all your Quicken data into GnuCash and remove one more
barrier to putting a nice <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
> ext2 </TT
> filesystem on that Windows
partition.

    </P
><P
>The problem is that GnuCash is a real double-entry accounting
system and Quicken has a pretty simplistic view about what an account
is, what a transaction is, and, most critically, is severely flawed in its datamodel, that is, <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
> what it saves in
data files.</I
> &#13;</P
><P
> Briefly, QIF files just don't contain enough information to
completely and accurately reconstruct your Quicken account hierarchy
in the GnuCash double entry system without some educated guessing by
the import code as well as some guidance, provided by you.
<P

><UL
><LI
><P
> QIF files omit small things that may be fairly accurately inferred by 
examining the data.&#13;</P
><P
> For instance, are numbers in decimal-radix [1,000.00 ==
1000] form or European comma-radix form [1.000,00 == 1000]?  </P

it can, but you <I

the system is designed so that you can correct problems <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"

done to your GnuCash accounts until you click the final "OK" button.

    </P
><P
>In the next section, I'll give an overview of the QIF file and
its "features".  This may seem unnecessarily technical, but if you at
least glance through it you will be much better able to understand
what's going on if you are having to jump through hoops to make make a
problematic file work right, and how you might be able to jump right
in and edit the QIF file to fix really tough problems.

    </P
><P
>There are two major "paths" for using the GnuCash QIF importer.
<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
> One is the "I am a Quicken user just migrating to GnuCash" path.&#13;</P
></LI
><LI
><P
> The other is the "I am downloading some updates from my bank as a
QIF file" path.&#13;</P
></LI
></UL
>&#13;</P
><P
> This document mainly focuses on the former case, since new users
are likely to need the most help and you really can't get started
using GnuCash until you can get your old records in.  Fortunately,
once you learn to do the former, the latter should be a piece of cake.
