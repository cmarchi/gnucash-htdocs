><P
>You've probably heard the saying, "Money doesn't
     grow on trees."  It means that money must come from
     somewhere---it doesn't just "appear."  Double-entry accounting is
     a method of record-keeping that lets you track just
     <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>where</I
> your money comes from and <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>     where</I
> it goes. </P
><P
> Using double-entry means that money is never gained nor lost---it
     is always transferred from somewhere (a source account) to
     somewhere else (a destination account).   In GnuCash, this
     transfer is known as a <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>transaction</I
>, and each
     transaction requires at least two accounts. </P
><P
>     An <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>account</I
> in GnuCash is a record for
     keeping track of what you own, owe, spend or receive.   For
     example,  if you pay a phone bill with a check, money transfers
     from checking to the phone company.  In GnuCash, this is a
     transaction transferring money from a checking account to a phone expense
     account.  You probably already think of your checking account as
     a  bank "account," but your expenses (such as phone bill) are
     also "accounts" in GnuCash.  </P
><P
>This double-entry concept has been around since the 13th century,
      and its purpose has always been to reduce the likelihood of 
      data-entry errors.  Fortunately, GnuCash makes it a lot easier
      to enter transactions than it was in those early days of
      accounting!

    it would be somewhat more accurate to call it <I

    than two accounts. Unfortunately, there's 700 years of
    history of use of the term, which sufficiently discourages
    changing it. </P
