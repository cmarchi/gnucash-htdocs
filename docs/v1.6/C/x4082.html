><P
>If your Quicken files have "Opening Balance" records, you will
see an account called "Opening Balance" in the Accounts tab.
Accounting for the source of opening balances is sort of a hassle,
when you think about it, because they come from accounts that are
outside the scope of the GnuCash universe.  The suggestion I've seen
on the gnucash-devel list is to make Opening Balances point to a
GnuCash account called "Retained Earnings", of type Equity.  I don't
exactly understand this but it seems reasonable, and it's the default
for accounts called "Opening Balance".

>In the Categories display, you may notice a blank QIF Category
entry.  Quicken transactions are not required to have a Category, but
GnuCash transactions are required to have a source and a destination.
The blank category lets you select which GnuCash account all
uncategorized transactions go to.  This will generally be
miscellaneous checks you have written, cash withdrawals, and so on, so
you probably want to put these in a "Misc Expenses" account or
something similar.  It may make sense to put this in an equity
account; let me know if there's a good explanation for how it should
be.

><P
>Quicken stock transactions have a recognizable pattern for
dividend payments.  If the importer can definitely tell that a
transaction is a transfer from dividends then it will default to
creating a "Dividend" income account.  This category is usually not
present in the Quicken file, so it's being manufactured out of
nowhere.

><P
>Quicken has the abstraction of a single account representing a
"fund family" for the purpose of allowing smooth transfers between the
various accounts administered within the family.  The GnuCash Importer
will ALWAYS get this wrong the first time, because Quicken explicitly
puts the wrong information in the file.  The "blanket" account
representing the fund family as a whole should probably be a Bank
account, since the transfers to and from it in the Quicken file are
denominated in currency, not shares.  The balance of such an account
is supposed to always be 0 since you just use it as an intermediary
between two accounts in the family.  Hopefully I'll fix this at some
point if someone tells me how it's supposed to work.

><P
>Brokerage accounts are really confusing to me.  Basically, my
thinking is that the brokerage account itself should probably be a
Bank account.  The only weirdness is in stuff like dividends paid from
securities to the brokerage account.  If you're using a Dividend
account, you can lose the information about where the dividend came
from.  The importer tries to save this information by putting the
security name in the Payee slot (which shows up in the GnuCash
Description field for the transaction).  If you have a better idea,
let me know.
