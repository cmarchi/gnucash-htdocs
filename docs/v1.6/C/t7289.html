><P
>The licenses for most software are designed to take away
    your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU
    General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
    share and change free software--to make sure the software is
    free for all its users. This General Public License applies to
    most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any
    other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other
    Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library
    General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your
    programs, too.

    </P
><P
>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,
    not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make
    sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free
    software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you
    receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can
    change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs;
    and that you know you can do these things.

    </P
><P
>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that
    forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to
    surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain
    responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
    software, or if you modify it.

    </P
><P
>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program,
    whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all
    the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too,
    receive or can get the source code. And you must show them
    these terms so they know their rights.

    </P
><P
>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the
    software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
    permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

    </P
><P
>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make
    certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for
    this free software. If the software is modified by someone else
    and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they
    have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by
    others will not reflect on the original authors'
    reputations.

    </P
><P
>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by
    software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that
    redistributors of a free program will individually obtain
    patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To
    prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be
    licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

    </P
><P
>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution
    and modification follow.
