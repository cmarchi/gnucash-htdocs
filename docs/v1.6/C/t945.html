> GnuCash supports a number of different account types.  
Always choose the type that is appropriate for what you want to
record.  If you're not sure, the following explanations should help you
decide.

     account types are used to record income and expenses.
     For example, if you deposit a paycheck in your bank account, you
should mark it as a transfer from an 'income' account.  
Marking income in this way helps balance the books: the change in your
net worth in the course of a few weeks, a few months, or a year, should
exactly equal your income (minus expenses) for the same period.  
The value stored in the bank account contributes to your 'net worth',
whereas the income contributes to your 'profits'.&#13;</P

><DD
><P
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Equity</I
> accounts are used to 
store the opening balances when you first start using GnuCash 
(or start a new accounting period).   
Assuming that you've had a bank
account far longer than you've been using GnuCash, and assuming you
don't want to type in old transactions, you will want to type in a
non-zero <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
> opening balance </I
>  into your bank account.  This opening balance
should be marked as a transfer from an account of type 'equity'.  
Alternately, if you close and reopen all your books at the end of every
quarter/year, the 'equity' will be your net-worth at the begining of the 
period: it equal all assets minus all liabilities.  
As time passes, you will have income and expenses. 
At the end of the year, your net
worth will be the equity at the begining of the year, plus all income
minus all expense.  This value then becomes the equity for
the next accounting period.

      In most ways, they behave like stocks, except that the
      only way that "income" may be gotten from them is from
      fluctuations in the relative values of currencies. Note that
      transfers cannot be made directly between two accounts
      denominated in different currencies. Such transfers may only
      be made into currency trading accounts.</P
