> GnuCash supports the import of Quicken
    Import Files (QIF). (Note: Only Quicken Version 3.0 QIF has
    been formally tested so far.) 

    </P
><P
>Note that the QIF format is representative of a somewhat
    peculiar data model that is not as expressive as one might
    wish; it requires dumping out a separate data file for each
    account, rather than permitting you to have one file that
    represents <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>all</I
> of the accounts you might have had in
    Quicken.

    </P
><P
>Furthermore, while there are plans to do so in the future,
    there is not, at this point, a way of mapping the account or
    category names used in Quicken to a <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>different</I
> set of
    account names that you might be using in GnuCash.

    </P
><P
>As a result, please read this section carefully. You may be
    somewhat disappointed with the results of a QIF import; this
    will at least give you some more accurate expectations as to
    what will happen.

        Future enhancements may allow you to delete them "en
        masse," or to make them invisible without deleting
        them.
