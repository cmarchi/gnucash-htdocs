>A/R (Accounts Receivable) and A/P (Accounts Payable) are used by
businesses to record sales for which they are not immediately paid, or
to record bills that they have received, but might not pay until
later.  These types of accounts are used primarily when you've got a
lot of bills and receipts flowing in and out, and don't want to lose
track of them just because you don't pay/get paid right away.  </P

that they are not worth the effort.  </P

>Let's assume that instead of requiring customers to pay
<I

and give them 30 days to pay the bills. (After 30 days, we start
charging interest and sending out harassing letters :-)).  When we

Accounts Receivable is an asset, but it's not "liquid," as you can't
readily sell it, and it's certainly not cash.  When the customer pays
the bill, you transfer the amount from A/R to Cash.  This is done in
two steps because you have decided to do your accounting on an accrual
basis and not on a cash basis.  This is because most of your
transactions are not solely based on cash changing hands, but rather
based on <I

>Sales are reported as soon as they occur.  Unfortunately, you
may wind up selling some product to no-good shady operators that you
didn't know were shady, and thus may get stuck with some "bad debts."
In order to determine which parts of Accounts Receivable appear to be
most at risk, it is typical to arrange A/R based on the "ages" of the
debts, commonly segmenting it into several aging periods, of payments
outstanding 0-30 days, those that outstanding 31-60 days, 61-90 days,
and then those that are <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>way overdue.</I
> At some
point, it may become clear that a customer is never going to pay what
they owe, and we have to write it off as a <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Bad
Debt.</I
> At that point, it is typical to record an entry thus:
