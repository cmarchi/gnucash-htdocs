>In a double-entry transaction, an equal amount of money is
    always transferred from one account (or group of accounts) to
    another account (or group of accounts).  Accountants use the terms
    <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>debit</I
> and <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
> credit</I
> to
    describe whether money is being transferred <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>    to</I
> or <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
> from</I
> an
    account. </P
><P
> Money is recorded in the debit column, which is the left
    column, when it is being transferred <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>to</I
> an
    account.  Money is recorded in the credit column, which is the
    right column, when it is being transferred
    <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>from</I
> an account. For every transaction, the
    total of debits (left column entries)
    must equal the total of credits (right column entries).

    </P
><P
> You don't have to use the terms "debit" and "credit" to use
    GnuCash, however.  GnuCash registers default to "common" column
    headings such as "deposit" and "withdrawal"---if you are more
    comfortable with those headings, use them.  If you prefer the
    credit and debit headings, you can change the column headings to
    "use accounting labels" from the menu item
    <B
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Settings|Preferences...General</B
>.</P
><P
>The main concept to remember, regardless of terminology, is
    that all transactions involve a transfer of some amount of money
    from a source to a destination. For example, if you write a check
    for $50 to buy groceries, you record that as a transfer of $50
    from the checking account to the groceries expense account.  In
    accounting terms, this is a credit to checking and a debit to
    groceries expense:</P
><P
CLASS="LITERALLAYOUT"
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debit&nbsp;Groceries&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credit&nbsp;Checking&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50</P
><P
>What about your paycheck?  You can see that money goes into a bank
      account, but where does it come from?  In double-entry, the
      money has to have a source, and the source of your paycheck is
      an income account.  So to enter the deposit of a $500 paycheck
      in your checking account, you record a transfer of $500 from an
      income account to a checking account.  In accounting terms, this
      is a credit to income and a debit to the bank account:</P
><P
CLASS="LITERALLAYOUT"
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debit&nbsp;Checking&nbsp;&nbsp;500<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credit&nbsp;Income&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;500</P

>        Bank statements are often written up from the bank's
        perspective, which is exactly <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>opposite</I
> to
        yours.  When you deposit that paycheck in the bank, you are
        giving the bank money which they promise to pay you back
        someday.  So to the bank, your deposit is a loan; it is money
        they owe you.  Since that money is a
        <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>source</I
> of funds to the bank, they show a
        <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>credit</I
> to your checking account when you
        deposit money in it.</P
