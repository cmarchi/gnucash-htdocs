    <span class="guilabel"><strong>Liability</strong></span> top level account and under this parent account create credit
    card type accounts for each credit card you use. If you are tracking only
    the payments you make to the credit card company, then all you need is a
    bank account and a credit card account to enter your transactions.</p><p>The charges you make on your credit card are expenses, so you will
    have to set up these accounts under the top-level account called
    <span class="guilabel"><strong>Expenses</strong></span>. If you decide to keep a more detailed records of your
    purchases, you will need to create expense accounts for each kind of
    purchase you make. Since you will also be reconciling the balance to your
    credit card statements, you should also enter an opening balance in each
    credit card account. The easiest way to do this is to use your last
    statement balance as the opening balance.</p><div class="sect2" title="6.2.1. Simple Setup"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="cc-accounts-simple2"></a>6.2.1. Simple Setup</h3></div></div></div><p>If you do not want to track each expense made on the credit card,
      you can set up a simple account hierarchy like this:</p><div class="literallayout"><p><br>
-Assets<br>
   -Bank<br>
-Liabilities<br>
   -Credit Card<br>
-Expenses<br>
   -Credit Card<br>
   </p></div><p>In this example, if you enter your total amount charged per month
      as a transaction between <span class="emphasis"><strong>Liabilities:Credit Card</strong></span> and
      <span class="emphasis"><strong>Expenses:Credit Card</strong></span>. When you make a payment, you would
      enter a transaction between <span class="emphasis"><strong>Assets:Bank</strong></span> and
      <span class="emphasis"><strong>Liabilities:Credit Card</strong></span>.</p><p>The obvious limitation of this simple credit card setup is that
      you cannot see where your money is going. All your credit card expenses
      are being entered in the Credit Card expense account. This is, however,
      very simple to set up and maintain.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="6.2.2. Complete Setup"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="cc-accounts-complete2"></a>6.2.2. Complete Setup</h3></div></div></div><p>If you want to track your expenses more completely, you should
      set up multiple expense accounts named for the various kinds of expenses
      you have. Each charge on your credit card is then entered as a separate
      transaction between your Credit Card liability account and a specific
      expense account. Below is an example of an account hierarchy for
      this:</p><div class="literallayout"><p><br>
-Assets<br>
    -Bank<br>
-Liabilities<br>
    -Credit Card<br>
-Expenses<br>
    -Food<br>
    -Car<br>
    -Clothes<br>
    -Entertainment<br>
    -Interest<br>
    -Service<br>
   </p></div><p>Clearly, you should enter specific expense accounts which fit your
      spending habits. The only difference with this setup as compared to the
      simple setup is that the expenses have been subdivided by groups. Also
      notice that there is an <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Interest</span>”</span> expense, this is used for when your
      credit card charges interest on your monthly unpaid balance. The
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Service</span>”</span> expense account is used to track service expenses associated
      with the credit card, such as the yearly usage fee if it exists. With
      this setup, you will be able to see where your money goes every month,
      grouped according to the expense accounts.</p><p>The rest of this chapter will assume you are using the complete
      setup.</p></div></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" class="navfooter"><hr></hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="cc-concepts1.html">&lt;&lt;&lt; Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="cc-entercharge1.html">Next &gt;&gt;&gt;</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left">6.1. Concepts </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="chapter_cc.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> 6.3. Entering Charges</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
