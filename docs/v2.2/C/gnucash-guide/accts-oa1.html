    frequently encountered business and less-frequently found personal activities
    that need recording in accounting books. The explanations below cover both the
    description and purpose of the activity, and they include also the usual
    accounting treatments (bookings or recordings) for these transactions.</p><p>These concepts have evolved over centuries of experience by those
    keeping accounting records and will help you maximize your record keeping’s
    utility and meaningfulness.</p><p>This section introduces categorization of assets in the balance sheet
    based on time or the asset’s useful life (current and long-term). Sometimes
    assets are also considered from the standpoint of their <b>liquidity
    </b>, which is regarded as how close or distant the asset is from
    being turned into cash. Near-cash assets are relatively quickly converted
    to cash (e.g., accounts receivable), while assets requiring rather a long
    time to convert to cash are considered to be relatively <b>fixed
    </b> in their non-cash state (e.g., heavy equipment, buildings, land).
    (Fixed does not mean they were repaired!)</p><p>You should find that current assets parallel those with more liquidity,
     while long-term and fixed assets are those with much less liquidity. Finally,
     below you will find a few assets that could be either current or long-term
     based on the nature of the facts constituting them.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" class="navfooter"><hr></hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="chapter_other_assets.html">&lt;&lt;&lt; Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="accts-oa2.html">Next &gt;&gt;&gt;</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left">Chapter 16.
