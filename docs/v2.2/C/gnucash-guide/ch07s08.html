    some different options. Here we will go through two of them, one in which 
    you only recorded the purchase amount, and now the selling amount. The other
    where you have followed the ups and downs on the property market and registered
    various Unrealized gains over the time.</p><p></p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2634370"></a>7.8.1.

          move this amount to your bank account. That means you are lacking
          #300k. This amount you fetch from the Income:Captial Gains Long:House

          let's move $230k of it to your bank account. After this you have $70k

          the years kept a close look on the market and updated your
          records with the estimated current value of your house. At the time
          you want to sell it, you have determined that the current market
          value is $600,000. </p><p>The difference between $600,000 (estimated market value), and 
          $300,000 (purchase value) is the current Unrealized Gain value. Therefore
          you have a total of $300,000 in your 
          <b>Assets:Fixed Assets:House:Unrealized Gain</b> account</p><p>How do you record this sell transaction?</p><p>To record this you need to increase your bank account with the
          $600k, and decrease some other accounts with $600k.
          You must first change from unrealized gain to realized gain 
          for your Income accounts.
          Lastly you need to transfer the full amounts from the "Assets:Fixed Assets:House"
          sub-accounts.</p><p>The transaction you enter into your 
          <b>Income:Realized Gain:House</b>
