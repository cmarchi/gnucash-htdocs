      accounting features.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p><b>Double Entry</b>: Every transaction must
          debit one account and credit others by an equal amount. This ensures
          the "books balance" - that the difference between income and expense
          exactly equals the sum of all bank, cash, stock and other
          assets.</p></li><li><p><b>Split Transactions</b>: A single transaction
          can be split into several pieces to record taxes, fees, and other
          compound entries.</p></li><li><p><b>Chart of Accounts</b>: A master account can
          have a hierarchy of detail accounts underneath it. This allows
          similar account types such as Cash, Bank, or Stock to be grouped
          into a master account such as “Assets”.</p></li><li><p><b>General Ledger</b>: One register window can
          display multiple accounts at the same time. This eases the trouble
          of tracking down typing/entry errors. It also provides a convenient
          way of viewing a portfolio of many stocks, by showing all
          transactions in that portfolio.</p></li><li><p><b>Income/Expense Account Types
          (Categories)</b>: These categorize your cash flow and, when
          used properly with the double-entry feature, will provide an
          accurate Profit&amp;Loss statement.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="oview-featuresnewstable2"></a>1.2.6. What’s New in 2.2</h3></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p><b><tt>GnuCash</tt></b> is available on
          Windows.</p></li><li><p>The <b><tt>GnuCash</tt></b> file format is

          scheduled transactions are stored differently. Using version
          2.2, you can upgrade your older
          <b><tt>GnuCash</tt></b> file to the new format.</p></li><li><p>More translations.</p></li><li><p>Improved report handling.</p></li><li><p>Fixed lots of crashes.</p></li><li><p>Improved multi-currency support.</p></li><li><p>Enhanced QIF import.</p></li></ul></div><p>See <a href="http://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/Release_Schedule#Release_Schedule_for_2.2.x" target="_top">http://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/Release_Schedule#Release_Schedule_for_2.2.x</a>
