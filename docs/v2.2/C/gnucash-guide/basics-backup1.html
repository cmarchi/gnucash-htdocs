Backing Up and Recovering Data</h2></div></div><p>GnuCash creates several types of files to help ensure that your data
    is not lost. You may see files with the following file extensions: xac,
    log, LCK, LNK in the same directory as your primary data file. What each
    of these files does is presented below.</p><pre class="programlisting">
      $ ls 
      gcashdata
      gcashdata.20060414185747.xac
      gcashdata.20060414223248.log
      gcashdata.20060415114340.xac
      gcashdata.20060415154508.log
      gcashdata.20060415173322.xac
      gcashdata.20060415194251.log
      gcashdata.7f0982.12093.LNK
      gcashdata.LCK
    </pre><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="basics-backupxac2"></a>2.8.1. Backup file (.xac)</h3></div></div><p>Each time you save your data file, a backup copy will also be
      saved with the extension xac. This backup file is a complete copy of
      your previous data file, and the filename format refers to the data
      file, year, month, day and time of the backup. For example, the filename
      <tt>gcashdata.20060414185747.xac</tt> indicates this is a
      backup copy of the file gcashdata saved in the year 2006, April 14, at
      6:57:47 p.m.</p><p>To restore an old backup file, simply open the .xac file with the
      date to which you wish to return. Be sure and save this file under a
      different name; do not use a .xac extension for a regular data file
      name.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="basics-backuplog2"></a>2.8.2. Log file (.log)</h3></div></div><p>Each time you open a file in GnuCash, a .log is created and saved
      with the same name format as the .xac backup files. As you make changes
      to the open data file, the log file saves only those changes. Log files
      are not a full backup of your data file - they simply record changes you
      have made to the data file in the current GnuCash session.</p><p>In case you exit GnuCash inadvertently, possibly due to a power
      outage or a system wide crash, it is possible to recover most of your
      work since the last time you saved your GnuCash file using this log
      file. This is the procedure:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p>Open the last saved GnuCash file.</p></li><li><p>Go to "File" -&gt; "Import" -&gt; "Replay GnuCash .log file"
          and select the one .log file with the same date as the saved file
          you just opened. Make sure that you picked the right .log file, or
          you will possibly wreak havoc in your accounts.</p></li></ul></div><p>Log replaying will recover any transaction affecting the balance
      entered since the last save, including those created from scheduled
      transactions and business features (invoices, bills, etc.).</p><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" xmlns:doc="http://nwalsh.com/xsl/documentation/1.0" class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img src="./stylesheet/note.png"></img></td><th align="left" valign="top">Note</th></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><p xmlns="">Warning: Changes to the scheduled transactions, invoices or
        bills themselves are NOT recovered, and their transactions that were
        recovered may not be properly associated with them, and should thus be
        double-checked. Especially for business transactions, you may have to
        delete and re-create some of them. If you do not, although the balance
        will be correct, some reports may not.</p></td></tr></table></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="basics-backuplock2"></a>2.8.3. Lock files (.LNK and .LCK)</h3></div></div><p>You may occasionally see .LNK and .LCK files appear. These do not
      store any data, but they are created to prevent more than one user from
      opening the same file at the same time. These files are automatically
      created when you open the file, to lock it so no one else can access it.
      When you close your GnuCash session or open another file, GnuCash
      unlocks the first data file by deleting the LCK and LNK files.</p><p>If GnuCash crashes while you have a data file open, the LCK and
      LNK files are not deleted. The next time you try to open GnuCash, you
      will get a warning message that the file is locked. The warning message
      appears because the LNK and LCK files are still in your directory. It is
      safe to choose Yes to open the file, but you should delete the .LNK and
      .LCK files (using a terminal window or your file manager.) Once those
      files are deleted, you will not get the warning message again unless
      GnuCash crashes.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="basics-backupmanage2"></a>2.8.4. File Management</h3></div></div><p>So which files should you keep around? Keep your main data file,
      of course - data files do not have an automatic file extension. It's a
      good idea to keep some of the more recent .xac files, but you can safely
      delete the .log files since they are not complete copies of your data.
      You should also delete any .LCK and .LNK files that you see after
      closing GnuCash. If you decide to back up your data file to another
      disk manually, you only need to back up the main data file - not the .xac
      files.</p><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" xmlns:doc="http://nwalsh.com/xsl/documentation/1.0" class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img src="./stylesheet/note.png"></img></td><th align="left" valign="top">Note</th></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><p xmlns="">GnuCash will automatically delete any .xac, .log files that are
