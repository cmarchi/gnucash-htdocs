Reconciliation</h2></div></div><p>Transactions are typically checked against bank statements - a
    process known as "reconciliation". <b><tt>GnuCash</tt></b> keeps track of the
    reconciliation status of each transaction.</p><p>The reconciliation status of a transaction is shown by the
    reconciliation (R) field. 'y' indicates that a transaction has been
    reconciled, 'n' indicates that it has not, and 'c' indicates that it has
    been cleared, but not reconciled. You can toggle the reconciliation status
    between 'n' and 'c' by clicking in the (R) field; you can set it to 'y' by
    using the Reconciliation Window.</p><p>At the bottom of the account window, there are two running totals:
    'Balance', and 'Cleared'. 'Cleared' should correspond to how much money
    the bank thinks you have in your account, while 'Balance' includes
    outstanding transactions.</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="txns-reconcile-window2"></a>4.5.1. Reconcile Window</h3></div></div><p>The Reconciliation Window is used to reconcile a <b><tt>GnuCash</tt></b> account
      with a statement that a bank or other institution has sent you.
      Reconciliation is useful not only to double-check your records against
      those of your bank, but also to get a better idea of outstanding
      transactions, e.g. uncashed checks.</p><p>At the bottom of the account window, there are two running
      balances: the "cleared and reconciled" balance, and the "total" balance.
      The "cleared and reconciled" balance should correspond to how much money
      the bank thinks you have in your account, and the "total" balance
      includes outstanding transactions.</p><p>For example, when you write a check for something, you should
      enter the transaction into <b><tt>GnuCash</tt></b>. The reconciliation (R) field of the
      transaction will initially contain n (new). Your new entry will
      contribute to the "total" balance, but not to the "cleared and
      reconciled" balance. Later, if you think that the check has been cashed,
      you might click on the transaction's R field to change it to c
      (cleared). When you do this, the "cleared and reconciled" balance will
      change to include this amount. When the bank statement arrives, you can
      then compare it to what you've recorded in <b><tt>GnuCash</tt></b> in the Reconciliation
      window. There, you will be able to change the R field to y (reconciled).
      You cannot reconcile in the register window, you must use the
      reconciliation window. Once a transaction has been marked "reconciled",
      it can no longer be easily changed.</p><p>To use the Reconciliation Windows, select an account from the
      account tree and click on <b>Actions</b> -&gt;
      <b>Reconcile</b>. A window will appear in which you can
      enter the reconcile information.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="figures/txns_reconcile_window1.png" alt="Reconcile Window"><div class="caption"><p>The initial reconcile window.</p></div></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p><b>Reconcile Info: Statement Date</b> - this is
          the date of the statement you will be reconciling against.</p></li><li><p><b>Reconcile Info: Starting Balance</b> - this
          is a non-editable item which displays the balance from the previous
          reconciliation. It should match the starting balance in your
          statement.</p></li><li><p><b>Reconcile Info: Ending Balance</b> - this is
          the ending balance as it appears in the statement.</p></li><li><p><b>Reconcile Info: Include Sub-accounts</b> -
          select this if you want to include the sub-accounts of the currently
          selected account in this reconciliation.</p></li><li><p><b>Enter Interest Payment</b> - click here to
          enter an interest transaction to the account to be
          reconciled.</p></li></ul></div><p>Click on the Ok button, and you will see
      the transactions listing reconcile window:</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="figures/txns_reconcile_window2.png" alt="Reconcile Window"><div class="caption"><p>The transactions listing in the reconcile
          window.</p></div></div></div><p>The two lists called <b>Funds In</b> and
      <b>Funds Out</b> lists all the unreconciled transactions.
      The 'R' columns show whether the transactions have been cleared or
      reconciled.</p><p>Now, examine each item on the bank statement, and look for the
      matching item in the Reconcile window.</p><p>If you cannot find one, then perhaps you forgot to enter a
      transaction, or did not know that the transaction had happened. You can
      use the New button on the tool bar, or the New menu item in the
      Transaction menu, to open a register window and enter the missing
      transaction. The new item will appear in the Reconcile window when you
      press enter after entering the transaction.</p><p>When you find the item in the Reconcile window, compare the amount
      in the item to the amount on the statement. If they disagree, you may
      have made an error when you entered the transaction in <b><tt>GnuCash</tt></b>. You can
      use the Edit button on the tool bar, or the
      <b>Edit</b> menu item in the Transaction menu, to open a
      register window and correct the transaction.</p><p>If the amounts agree, click on the item in the Reconcile window.
      The 'R' column will change to 'y' (reconciled) from 'n' or 'c'.  You
      may also use the up/down arrow keys to scroll to the item and then
      press the space key.  This will also change the 'R' column to show the
      item as reconciled.</p><p>You then repeat this for each item that appears on the bank
      statement, verifying that the amounts match with the amounts in <b><tt>GnuCash</tt></b>,
      and marking off transactions in <b><tt>GnuCash</tt></b> as they are reconciled.</p><p>At the bottom of the "Reconcile" window is a "Difference" field,
      which should show $0.00 when you are done reconciling. If it shows some
      other value, then either you have missed transactions, or some amounts
      may be incorrect in <b><tt>GnuCash</tt></b>. (Or, less likely, the bank may have made an
      error.)</p><p>When you have marked off all the items on the bank statement, and
      when the difference is $0.00, press the Finish button on the tool bar or
      select Finish from the Reconcile menu. The Reconcile window will close.
      In the Register window, the R field of the reconciled transactions will
      change to 'y'.</p><p>In this case, we have not received all the information yet, so we
      simply press the Postpone, so we can continue at
      a later stage. Observe that the 'R' column indicates we cleared ('c')
      two transactions. They have not been reconciled yet, but we have
      verified these two transactions so they have been marked as cleared. If
      you look at the status bar at the bottom of the account register, you
      will see a summary of what has been reconciled and what has been cleared
      (<b>Cleared:USD 954.79 Reconciled:USD 0.00</b>)</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="figures/txns_reconcile_window3.png" alt="Checking account"><div class="caption"><p>The Checking account after postponed the
