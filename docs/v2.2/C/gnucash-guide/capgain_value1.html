Estimating Valuation</h2></div></div><p>As mentioned in the introduction to this chapter, capital gains are
    the profits received from the sale of an asset. This section will describe
    how to record capital gains in GnuCash.</p><p>The accounting methods for handling asset appreciation differs
    somewhat from depreciation because typically you are only concerned with
    the moment you sell the asset and realize the capital gains. This is
    opposed to the continuous nature of tracking depreciation. Capital gains
    are an important subject in the world of taxation, because governments
    tend to be quite interested in taxing capital gains in one manner or
    another.</p><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" xmlns:doc="http://nwalsh.com/xsl/documentation/1.0" class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img src="./stylesheet/note.png"></img></td><th align="left" valign="top">Note</th></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><p xmlns="">As always, there are exceptions. If you hold a bond that pays all
      of its interest at maturity, tax authorities often require that you
      recognize interest each year, and refuse this to be treated as a capital
      gain. Consult the appropriate tax codes to determine the preferred
      treatment for each type of asset you have which may be affected by
      capital gains taxes.</p></td></tr></table></div><p>Estimating the increasing value of assets is generally not simple,
    because often it is difficult to know its exact value until the moment it
    is sold.</p><p>Securities traded daily on open markets such as stock exchanges are
    possibly the easiest type of asset to predict the value of, and selling
    the asset at market prices may be as simple as calling a broker and
    issuing a Market Order. On the other hand, estimating the value of a house
    is more difficult. Homes are sold less often than stocks, and the sales
    tend to involve expending considerable effort and negotiations, which
    means that estimates are likely to be less precise. Similarly, selling a
    used automobile involves a negotiation process that makes pricing a bit
    less predictable.</p><p>Values of collectible objects such as jewelry, works of art,
    baseball cards, and "Beanie Babies" are even harder to estimate. The
    markets for such objects are much less open than the securities markets
    and less open than the housing market. Worse still are one-of-a-kind
    assets. Factories often contain presses and dies customized to build a
    very specific product that cost tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars;
    this equipment may be worthless outside of that very specific context. In
    such cases, several conflicting values might be attached to the asset,
    none of them unambiguously correct.</p><p>The general rule of thumb in accounting for estimating unrealized
    gains (or loses) is that you should only revalue assets such as stocks
    which are readily sellable and for which there are very good estimates of
    the value. For all other assets, it is better to simply wait until you
    sell them, at which time you can exactly determine the capital gains. Of
    course, there is no hard rule on this, and in fact different accountants
    may prefer to do this differently.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" class="navfooter"><hr></hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="capgain_concepts1.html">&lt;&lt;&lt; Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="capgain_accounts1.html">Next &gt;&gt;&gt;</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left">9.1.
