Entering Payments</h2></div></div><p>Most payments to your credit card bill are entered as transfers from
    a bank account (asset) to the credit card account (liability). When you
    pay the monthly bill, you are withdrawing money from a bank account to pay
    down the credit card balance. This transaction decreases both your bank
    account balance and the amount of credit card debt you owe.</p><p>When you return a purchase, you receive a refund on your credit
    card. This is another type of payment in that it decreases the amount of
    credit card debt you owe. If you recorded the original purchase
    transaction as a transfer from the credit card account to the expense, you
    now simply reverse that transaction: transfer the money back from the
    expense to the credit card account. This transaction decreases both the
    expense account balance and the credit card account balance. For example,
    if you originally recorded a credit card purchase of clothing, the
    transaction is a transfer from the credit card account to the clothing
    expense account. If you then return that clothing for a refund, you simply
    transfer the money back from the clothing expense account to the credit
    card account.</p><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" xmlns:doc="http://nwalsh.com/xsl/documentation/1.0" class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img src="./stylesheet/note.png"></img></td><th align="left" valign="top">Note</th></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><p xmlns="">A common mistake is to enter a refund as income. It is not income,
      but rather a "negative expense". That is why you must transfer money
      from the expense account to your credit card when you receive a
      refund.</p></td></tr></table></div><p>To clarify this, let's run through an example. You bought some jeans
    for $74.99 on your VISA card, but realized one day later that they are too
    big and want to return them. The shop gracefully agrees, and refunds your
    credit card.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Start with opening the previous datafile we stored

        <b>Charge</b> your Visa account with the $74.99.</p><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" xmlns:doc="http://nwalsh.com/xsl/documentation/1.0" class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img src="./stylesheet/note.png"></img></td><th align="left" valign="top">Note</th></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><p xmlns="">Since we had not created the Expense:Clothes account
