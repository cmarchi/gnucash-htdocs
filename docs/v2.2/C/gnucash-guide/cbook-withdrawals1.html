Entering Withdrawals</h2></div></div><p>When you withdraw money from your bank account, for whatever reason,
    you are transferring money from your bank account to some other location.
    In <b><tt>GnuCash</tt></b>, this other location is tracked as an account. The more
    detailed accounts you create and use for your spending, the more
    information you will get about where your money goes.</p><p>Withdrawals take many forms. ATM withdrawals are one of the most
    common transactions. Writing checks is one way to withdraw money to pay
    bills, to buy purchases, or to give to charity. Depending on your bank,
    you might also have service charges, where the bank withdraws the money
    from your account. Transfers of money out to another account are also
    withdrawals. We will take a look at each of these types of withdrawals and
    how to record them in <b><tt>GnuCash</tt></b>.</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="cbook-atm2"></a>5.3.1. ATM/Cash Withdrawals</h3></div></div><p>Cash withdrawals are handled as a transfer from a bank account to
      a cash account. <b><tt>GnuCash</tt></b> provides special <b>Cash</b> type
      accounts for tracking your cash purchases, so you should set up a cash
      account to record your ATM and other cash withdrawals.</p><p>Cash accounts can be used for different levels of detail. On a
      basic level of detail, you simply transfer money to it from your
      checking account. That tells you how much money you took out of checking
      on a given day, but it doesn't tell you where that cash was spent. With
      a little more effort, you can use the cash account to record your cash
      purchases as well, so that you can see where that cash went. You record
      these purchases as a transfer from the cash account to expense
      accounts.</p><p>Some people record every cash purchase, but this takes a lot of
      work. An easier way is to record the purchases for which you have
      receipts, but then adjust the balance of the account to match what is in
      your wallet.</p><p>It's a good idea to at least set up a cash account for your
      withdrawals. Then if you decide to track where your cash goes, you can
      enter transactions for the money you spend. You determine what level of
      detail you want to use.</p></div></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" class="navfooter"><hr></hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="cbook-deposits1.html">&lt;&lt;&lt; Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="cbook-reconacct1.html">Next &gt;&gt;&gt;</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left">5.2.
