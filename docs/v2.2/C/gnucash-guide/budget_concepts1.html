Basic Concepts</h2></div></div><p>A budget is a tool for estimating expected income and expenses.
 You can use it to help you plan how you intend for your finances to
 change over a period of time, and to examine how your actual
 financial transactions for the period compare to your planned
 transactions.</p><p>The budgeting concept is quite general, so GnuCash offers a
budgeting tool that is both simple and flexible.  You, the user, have
to decide how complex or simple you want to make your budget.  This
guide will help you make some of those decisions.</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="budget_conceptsterms2"></a>15.1.1. Terminology</h3></div></div><p>There are a few helpful terms listed
  below that will be used to discuss budgeting.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p><b>Budget</b> - A financial plan describing
    the expected revenues and/or disbursements for a particular time
    period</p></li><li><p><b>Cash Budget</b> - A budget planning for
    expected cash receipts and cash disbursements.  This type of
    budget tracks cash flow -- where your money comes from, where it
    goes, and, of course, how much.</p></li><li><p><b>Expense Budget</b> - A budget chiefly for
    planning what you spend your money on.  This type of budget tracks
    your expenses.  It is typically not concerned with things like
    appreciation or repayment of liabilities.  However, it would
    account for interest charges.  For example, if you buy $100 worth
    of groceries with your credit card, you incur an $100 expense for
    groceries, and a $100 liability to your credit card company.  When
    you pay the credit card bill for $110, you are incurring an
    additional interest expense of $10.  An expense budget plans for
    the transaction of buying the groceries and paying the interest,
    but not the transaction of repaying the credit card
    company.</p></li><li><p><b>Capital Budget</b> - A budget that
    describes a plan for paying for a large future expense, often
    through a combination of saving and borrowing money.  Note:
    Capital budgets can sometimes get quite complex because they can
    try to answer the question "Can we afford to do such-and-such?" by
    exploring various hypothetical scenarios that can involve
    hypothetical accounts.  </p></li><li><p><b>Budget Period</b> - The period of time
    during which the plan is expected to take place.  The most common
    budget periods are annual and monthly.  Sometimes, you may budget
    for several consecutive periods at once, for convenience or for
    finer-grained planning.  For example, an annual budget may include
    12 monthly budget periods.</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" class="navfooter"><hr></hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="chapter_budgets.html">&lt;&lt;&lt; Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="budget_creation1.html">Next &gt;&gt;&gt;</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left">Chapter 15.
