Scheduling Transactions</h2></div></div><p>Scheduled Transactions provide the ability to have reminders scheduled or transactions scheduled to be
      entered at a specified date. This is combined with the <b>Since Last Run
      </b> assistant (<a href="trans-sched-slr.html" title="7.2. Since Last Run Assistant">Since Last Run Assistant</a>) to review and enter the transactions. The
      <b>Mortgage &amp; Loan Repayment</b> assistant (<a href="trans-sched-loans.html" title="7.3. Mortgage &amp; Loan Repayment Assistant">Mortgage &amp; Loan Repayment Assistant</a>) is used
      to setup a scheduled transaction to repay a compounding interest loan. The Scheduled Transaction Editor
      (<a href="sched-editor.html" title="6.12. Edit Scheduled Transaction Window">Edit Scheduled Transaction Window</a>) is used to create and edit transactions that are to be added to the
      register in an automated way.</p><p>The easiest way to setup a scheduled transaction is to use an existing transaction in an account register
      as a template. Select the transaction you wish to use as a template and then either select the
      <b>Schedule</b> icon on the toolbar or go to <b>Actions -&gt; Schedule...</b>.
      This will bring up the <b>Make Scheduled Transaction</b> dialog.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p><b>Name:</b> Enter a name to use for the scheduled transaction. This will be
         used in the Description file of the transaction.</p></li><li><p><b>Frequency:</b> Choose the time period you want between scheduled entries. The
         dates that the transactions will be entered will show in the mini calendar pane to the right.</p></li><li><p><b>Start Date:</b> Choose a date for the scheduled transaction to start.</p></li><li><p><b>Never End:</b> This scheduled transaction has no finish date.</p></li><li><p><b>End Date:</b> Choose a date for the scheduled transaction to end.</p></li><li><p><b>Number of Occurrences:</b> Enter the number of times you wish the scheduled
         transaction to be added to the register.</p></li></ul></div><p>The <b>Advanced...</b> button brings up the Scheduled Transaction Editor's dialog to
        Edit the Scheduled Transaction. This is described in the section Scheduled Transaction Editor.

Scheduled Transactions Window</h3></div></div><p>The Scheduled Transaction Window is used to access the list of scheduled transactions and create,
          edit or remove them. It also provides a calendar which displays upcoming scheduled transactions. Clicking
          on the calendar view and hovering over any date will pop up a small dialog that shows the transactions
          scheduled for that day. The yellow highlight in the calendar indicates which days have scheduled
          transactions. To dismiss the hover dialog click once more.</p><p>The top pane of the Scheduled Transaction Window contains the list of scheduled transactions that are
          currently setup. This window lists the Name of the transaction, if the transaction is enabled for scheduling,
          the Frequency (month and day) that the transaction is to be entered, the last time the transaction was entered
          and the next time the transaction will be entered.</p><p>The right side of this pane contains a down arrow button that when "clicked" will pull-down a window to
          allow selection of the characteristics displayed in the list.  Unchecking the appropriate box will remove the
          characteristic from the display.</p><p>The tool bar of this window contains three buttons to create, delete and edit scheduled transactions.
          New and Edit opens the Edit Scheduled Transaction dialog. Delete removes the selected scheduled transaction.
          The same options are available thru <b>Schedule -&gt; New/Edit/Delete</b>, from the Scheduled
          Transaction Tab. </p><p>Below the list of scheduled transactions is the Upcoming calendar. This calendar displays up to the next
          year and highlights the dates that the scheduled transactions are scheduled to occur so it is easy to see when
          the transactions are scheduled.  Clicking on a date in the calendar brings up a list of scheduled transactions
          for that date. Moving the mouse over other dates changes to the list of transactions on those dates. Clicking
          once more on the calendar removes the transaction list.</p><p>The Scheduled Transaction Window is activated from the Account tab or the Transaction Register via
          <b>Actions -&gt; Scheduled Transactions -&gt; Scheduled Transaction Editor</b>,</p></div></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" class="navfooter"><hr></hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="acct-jump.html">&lt;&lt;&lt; Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="help.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="sched-editor.html">Next &gt;&gt;&gt;</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left">6.10.
