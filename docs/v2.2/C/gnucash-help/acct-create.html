                Internet and install the Finance::Quote module on your system. The gnc-fq-update program is interactive,
                however, with most systems you should be able to answer “no” to the first question:
                “Are you ready for manual configuration? [yes]” and the update will continue automatically
                from that point.</p></li></ol></div><p>After installation is complete, you should run the “gnc-fq-dump” test program, in the

          “&lt;gnucash-file-name&gt;” will depend on the name and location of your
          data file.  This can be determined by the name displayed in the top frame of the GnuCash window,
          before the “-”.  The file name can also be found “File -&gt;”
