Multiple Split Transactions</h2></div></div><p>The register window will look slightly different depending on the style options you have chosen.
     The following describes entering transactions with multiple splits in the basic ledger style. GnuCash describes
     as a "Split" when money is transferred to or from more than two accounts in a transaction.
     The cursor is placed in the date field by default when the register window is opened.</p><p>The multiple account lines will not be displayed in the Basic Ledger unless the <b>Split</b>
     icon or the <b>Action &gt; Split Transaction</b> option have been selected.
    </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Selecting the triangle icon on the right of the date field drops down a date selection dialog.
          Use the arrows to select the correct month and year for the transaction then select the date. Selecting
          the icon once more will close the date selection calendar. It is also possible to type in the
          date or part of the date and let GnuCash fill the rest.</p></li><li><p>Press <b>Tab</b> to move to or select the "Num" field. Here you can enter a check or
          transaction number.  Pressing <b>+</b> (plus) will automatically advance the number by one from
          the last transaction to have a number.</p></li><li><p>Press <b>Tab</b> to move to or select the "Description" field. This field is used to enter
          either a payee or other description for the transaction. It will automatically attempt to fill the payee name
          as you type.</p></li><li><p>At this stage one of two things will happen if tab is pressed. If GnuCash matches an existing
          transaction the cursor will jump to one of the amount fields, automatically filling in the transfer
          account.  Selecting any field with the mouse instead of tabbing will not automatically fill the
          transferring account field.  If there is no matching (existing) transaction, GnuCash will move the
          cursor to the "Transfer" field with only one line of the transaction supplied.</p></li><li><p>When typing in the Transfer field GnuCash will also attempt to automatically match the account.
          It does this alphabetically, so typing 'Ex' will match the Expenses section of the account list.
          When the section is matched, it is possible to move to a child account by pressing <b>:</b> (colon).
          If after typing 'Ex' you press <b>:</b> then the cursor will move to the first child account in the
          list.  Typing combinations of letters and <b>:</b> will allow movement down the tree of accounts
          quickly. The icon on the right of the Transfer box can be used as an alternate way of selecting accounts.
         </p></li><li><p>The next field is used for reconciliation. This is described in the To Reconcile an Account
          to a Statement section.  <a href="acct-reconcile.html" title="5.8. Reconciling an Account to a Statement">Reconciling an Account to a Statement</a></p></li><li><p>Press <b>Tab</b> to move to the first of the amount fields. The names of the next two columns
          are different according to what type of account is opened. For example, Bank accounts show 
          Deposit and Withdrawal here, Credit Card accounts show Payment and Charge, and Stock accounts
          show Shares, Price, Buy and Sell.</p></li><li><p>Enter the total amount for the transaction in the correct field. Before pressing <b>Tab</b>
          or <b>Enter</b> read next step.</p></li><li><p>To enter the additional splits, press the Split button on the toolbar or select 
          <b>Actions -&gt; Split Transaction</b>. Transactions with more than one split show
          '--Split Transaction--' and the Split button will need to be used
          to show the details.</p></li><li><p>The display will expand, the titles of the amount columns will be renamed and the Transfer
          column name will be blank. The first line contains the description and the amount of the transaction.
          The second line contains the currently opened account name in the Account field and the amount of
          the transaction. The third line contains the transfer account name in the Account field. If the
          amount is not balanced GnuCash will indicate this by placing gray check-boxes in the amount columns
          with the unbalanced amount in a blank last row.</p></li><li><p>When one of the short lines is selected, the column titles will change. The very first and last
          (Date and Balance) columns will have blank titles. Num will change to Action, Description to Memo,
          the now blank Transfer column will change to Account. The last two amount columns will show the name
          described in step seven.</p></li><li><p>The Action and Memo columns are optional to fill out at this stage. Action is used to describe
          what kind of account transfer is involved. Memo is an additional description of the transfer.</p></li><li><p>Move to the missing amount field on the third line and fill in the amount. Pressing the
          <b>Enter</b> key, selecting the Enter icon or going to <b>Actions
          -&gt; Enter</b> will now move the cursor to the next line.</p></li><li><p>The Account column contains the list of transfer accounts. This column is the one that is used
          to add splits. The method described in step five can be used to select another account on a blank line.
          Add as many additional splits as needed.</p></li><li><p>When the transaction is balanced the gray check-boxes will disappear and the last blank line will
          not have an amount.</p></li><li><p>Pressing <b>Enter</b> as described above past the blank line will jump to the next
          transaction. Selecting the next transaction will close the split or it can be manually closed by pressing
          the Split icon or selecting <b>Actions -&gt; Split Transaction</b>.</p></li></ol></div></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" class="navfooter"><hr></hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="trans-enter.html">&lt;&lt;&lt; Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="help.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="trans-currency-enter.html">Next &gt;&gt;&gt;</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left">6.3.
