Enter Transaction via register</h2></div></div><p>When the Account Register Window for an account is opened the list of transactions for that
      account is shown. This window has the name of the account on its tab. The menus contain several
      functions that alter the display of transactions. The toolbar also contains several functions that are
      often used when entering or manipulating transactions. These are described in the
      <a href="ch04s03.html#account-register" title="4.3.1. Account Register &amp; General Ledger Window">Account Register &amp; General Ledger Window</a> section of this document.</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="trans-reg-enter"></a>6.3.1. Entering Directly in the Register Window</h3></div></div><p>The register window will look slightly different depending on the style options you have chosen.
       The following describes entering simple transactions in the basic ledger style. The cursor is placed
       in the date field by default when the register window is opened.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Selecting the small icon on the right of the date field drops down a date selection calender.
            Use the arrows to select the correct month and year for the transaction then select the date.
            Selecting the icon once more will close the date selection calender. It is also possible to
            type in the date or part of the date and let GnuCash fill the rest.</p></li><li><p>Press <b>Tab</b> to move to or select the "Num" field. Here you can enter a check or
            transaction number.  Pressing <b>+</b> (plus) will automatically advance the number by one from
            the last transaction to have a number.</p></li><li><p>Press <b>Tab</b> to move or select the "Description" field. This field is used to enter
            either a payee or other description for the transaction. It will automatically attempt to fill the payee
            name as you type.</p></li><li><p>At this stage one of two things will happen if tab is pressed. If GnuCash matches an existing
            transaction the cursor will jump to one of the amount fields, automatically filling in the transfer
            account.  Selecting any field with the mouse instead of tabbing will not automatically fill the
            transferring account field.  If there is no matching (existing) transaction, GnuCash will move the
            cursor to the "Transfer" field with only one line of the transaction supplied.</p></li><li><p>When typing into the account field GnuCash will also attempt to automatically match the account
            name with an existing account.  It does this alphabetically, so typing 'Ex' will match the Expenses
            section of the account list. When the section is matched, it is possible to move to a child account by
            pressing <b>:</b> (colon). If after typing 'Ex' you press <b>:</b> then the cursor will
            move to the first child account in the list.  Typing combinations of letters and <b>:</b> will
            allow movement down the tree of accounts quickly. The triangle icon on the right of the Transfer box can
            be used as an alternate way of selecting accounts.  Up &amp; down arrow keys will also move up/down the
            displayed list of accounts.
           </p></li><li><p>The next field (R) is used for reconciliation. This is described in the <b>Reconcile an
            Account to a Statement</b> section.  <a href="acct-reconcile.html" title="5.8. Reconciling an Account to a Statement">Reconciling an Account to a Statement</a></p></li><li><p>Press tab to move to the first of the amount fields. The names of the next two columns are different
            according to what type of account is opened. For example, Bank accounts show Deposit and Withdrawal here,
            Credit Card accounts show Payment and Charge, and Stock accounts show Shares, Price, Buy and Sell.</p></li><li><p>Enter an amount for the transaction in the correct fields. When the transaction is "balanced"
            pressing the <b>Enter</b> key, selecting the Enter icon or going to
            <b>Transaction -&gt; Enter Transaction</b> will finish the transaction. Selecting the
            Cancel  icon or going to <b>Transaction -&gt; Cancel Transaction</b>
            will erase the transaction.</p></li><li><p>Transactions with just one transfer account will show the name of that account in the Transfer
            field in completed transactions. (The "Transfer field" is the fourth (4) from the left in the register
            display.)</p></li><li><p>To move to the blank transaction at the bottom of the register, press the 
            Blank toolbar icon or go to <b>Actions -&gt; Blank Transaction</b>.
           </p></li></ol></div></div></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" class="navfooter"><hr></hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="trans-win-enter.html">&lt;&lt;&lt; Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="help.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="trans-multi-enter.html">Next &gt;&gt;&gt;</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left">6.2.
