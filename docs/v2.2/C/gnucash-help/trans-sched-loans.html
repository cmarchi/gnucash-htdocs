Mortgage &amp; Loan Repayment Assistant</h2></div></div><p>This assistant creates a loan repayment scheduled transaction. When used to setup
           a scheduled transaction, the assistant creates a variable formula so that the
           compounding interest is correctly calculated. To start this assistant manually go to
           <b>Actions -&gt; Scheduled Transactions -&gt; Mortgage and Loan Repayment...</b> </p><p>The Mortgage and Loan Repayment assistant opens with a screen that briefly
