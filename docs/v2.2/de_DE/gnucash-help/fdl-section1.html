      This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
      notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
      distributed under the terms of this License. The
      “Document”, below, refers to any such manual or
      work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed
      as “you”.
    </p><p><a name="fdl-modified"></a>
      A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work
      containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied
      verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another
      language.
    </p><p><a name="fdl-secondary"></a>
      A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a
      front-matter section of the <a href="fdl-section1.html#fdl-document">Document</a> that deals exclusively
      with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the
      Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related
      matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within
      that overall subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a
      textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
      mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
      connection with the subject or with related matters, or of
      legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
      regarding them.
    </p><p><a name="fdl-invariant"></a>
      The “Invariant Sections” are certain <a href="fdl-section1.html#fdl-secondary"> Secondary Sections</a> whose titles
      are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
      notice that says that the <a href="fdl-section1.html#fdl-document">Document</a> is released under this
      License.
    </p><p><a name="fdl-cover-texts"></a>
      The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of
      text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts,
      in the notice that says that the <a href="fdl-section1.html#fdl-document">Document</a> is released under this
      License.
    </p><p><a name="fdl-transparent"></a>
      A “Transparent” copy of the <a href="fdl-section1.html#fdl-document"> Document</a> means a machine-readable
      copy, represented in a format whose specification is available
      to the general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited
      directly and straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for
      images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for
      drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is
      suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic
      translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
      formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format
      whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
      subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy
      that is not “Transparent” is called
      “Opaque”.
    </p><p>
      Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include
      plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
      format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
      standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human
      modification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF,
      proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
      proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD
      and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the
      machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for
      output purposes only.
    </p><p><a name="fdl-title-page"></a>
      The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the
      title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to
      hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in
      the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title
      page as such, “Title Page” means the text near the
      most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the
      beginning of the body of the text.
