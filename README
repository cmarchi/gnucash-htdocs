- re-work page content for new-style translations (one big block)
  - re-flow existing po-file content.
- update features screenshots
- fix double-slash on langdir='' mlist search menu URLs

Notes about multi-lingual gnucash website content
-------------------------------------------------

- all pages must call lang.php to bring in gettext support.
- It would be nice to use the same containing structure for all translations.
- Phrase content can probably be po-style translated well.
- Body/paragraph content probably wants to be block-replaced.
- We're fine not doing auto-language negotiation.

There are three main classes of links:

- external resources [$top_dir[/externals]]
  - www: relative
  - !www: relative

- translations [$top_dir/[«lang»]]
  - www: relative
  - !www: relative

- navigation [$home]
  - www: relative
  - !www: url-prefixed ("http://www.gnucash.org/file.phtml")

                        | www.gnucash.org  |  lists.gnucash.org        |
                        +------------------+---------------------------+
           external (C) |   ./[externals/] |  ./[externals/]           | \
        external (lang) |  ../[externals/] | ../[externals/]           |  \,- $top_dir
        translation (C) |   ./[lang]       |  ./[lang]                 |  / 
     translation (lang) |  ../[lang]       | ../[lang]                 | /
         navigation (C) |   ./             | http://www.[...]/         |  \,- $home
      navigation (lang) |   ./             | http://www.[...]/[lang]/  |  /
                        +------------------+---------------------------+

As such:

  $top_dir := the relative reference to the top of the relative website; this
    should be used for language-independent resources (stylesheets, images, php
    includes), but not for links...

  $home := a prefix for navigational URLs; for everything but
    lists.gnucash.org, this'll be ".", but for lists.gnucash.org it'll
    be "http://www.gnucash.org/".

As well, the following variables should be set:

- per directory:

  $locale := the LANG to use for gettext.

- per file:

  $title := the text of the page.

  $homepage := if the file is the homepage; controls RSS feed linkage.

-------------------
Note about folders
-------------------
- "externals" folder contains images linked to external sources (e.g. logo_w120.png
  is used on the wiki and packtpub_gnucash_2.4cov.png is linked to the external 
  book website)

----------------------
Preparing translations
----------------------

First, make sure the pot file is up to date.  You can do that by running
the command:

    $ make pot

Now merge the new content into your translation, substituting the name of 
your po file in the command:

    $ msgmerge po/en_GB.po po/gnucash-htdocs.pot -o po/en_GB.po

Finally, see the size of the task ahead:

    $ msgfmt -c --statistics po/en_GB.po

Whilst editing the translation, run the msgfmt command from time to
time to catch errors and let you know how much is left to do.

When you come across fuzzy markers: (#, fuzzy), check whether the
proposed translation is a valid translation. If it is, then remove
the fuzzy marker. If it is not, either edit the translation and
remove the fuzzy marker, or leave the fuzzy marker where it is --
this message will then be treated as untranslated.

When you have no fuzzy and no untranslated messages, update the binary
translation file for your locale:

    $ make de [fr nl ...]

Which will build an individual translation, or:

    $ make mos

Which will make all the known translations.

----------------------
Publishing the website
----------------------

Changes that are committed to 'trunk' are published to
http://www.gnucash.org  automatically.
No other steps are required.

------------------------
Website beta environment
------------------------

Some changes may be too drastic or experimental to push to the public
website. There is a beta website available as well on

http://www.gnucash.org/beta/

To work in this beta environment, checkout the beta branch from svn:

svn checkout http://svn.gnucash.org/repo/htdocs/branches/beta htdocs-beta

WARNING: this branch is currently not kept in sync with trunk. So if you
         intend to experiment with the current conten in trunk, please ask
         one of the devs to merge the current trunk to beta first !

As with 'trunk', changes that are committed to 'beta' are published to
http://www.gnucash.org/beta automatically as well.
