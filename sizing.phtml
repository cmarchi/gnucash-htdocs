<?php echo T_("It can often be quite interesting to study the source code metrics behind a software development project.   Not a surprising interest: its accounting afterall. <span class=\"gnucash\">GnuCash</span> has grown, over the years, from a small handy electronic checkbook to a rather large and multi-featured desktop app.");?>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<?php echo T_("<span class=\"gnucash\">GnuCash</span> currently consists of over a third of a million lines of code spread over more than a thousand files.  It has been translated into twenty-three languages and credits over 139 authors and contributors.");?>

<?php echo T_("If you've had trouble swimming through that mass of source code, think of it this way: printed out on paper, and bound into volumes, it would amount to several dozen copies of Tolstoy's \"War and Peace\", roughly a bookshelf-width's worth of source code.");?>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<?php echo T_("Mind you, this is source code (and docs) crafted and debugged by actual humans, this is *not* autogenerated code.  Tools (such as glade or g-wrap) can generate gaziilions of lines of code automatically; I'm not counting those.  Every last line counted here was typed in, edited, indented, tweaked, multiple times, by human hands.");?>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<?php echo T_("Given that we have about 400 outstanding bugs in bugzilla, that works out to about one bug per thousand lines of code, or one bug per 50 pages of printout.  This bug count is actually not atypical for software projects; its near the norm.");?>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<?php echo T_("The table below shows some historical lines-of-code and number-of-files metrics for the <span class=\"gnucash\">GnuCash</span> development project.  Note that not all of the code is counted: for instance, the Makefiles and configure.in and autogen.sh are not counted. Also, files that are automatically generated are not counted, nor are files that have been 'borrowed' from other projects. Also not counted are experimental files, miscellaneous perl scripts, various converters, addons and utilities.  Finally, <tt>glade</tt> files are not counted, although large parts of the overall GUI are described in <tt>glade</tt> files.");?>
</P>
<p class="justify">
<?php echo T_("Note also that KLOC's are not a good metric of programmer productivity, nor even that <code>wc</code> is a good way of counting KLOC's.  Much better measures are complexity metrics, which, for example, count the number and size of if-then-else blocks, or the number and size of all blocks, or the number of math operators per statement.  Maybe someday we'll run one of those tools on this code. For now, this is what we have.  On the other hand, we've attempted to count only those files that contain human-edited code, that is, files that are directly edited by humans.  The point of doing this is to avoid artificially inflating the KLOC counts by counting automatically generated code (which is why the glade files are not counted: they are large and automatically generated).");?>
